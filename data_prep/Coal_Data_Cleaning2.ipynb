      "It\\'s serenely silent as I hike down the canyon walls. The only sounds are the crunch of my boots on the boulders, the occasional twitter of a bird and the gentle tumbling of the river. High above, towering orange cliffs loom, outlined against the deep blue sky. It\\'s a hot morning, so I stop for a swim. The cold water refreshes me instantly and I linger, soothing my muscles. Our group is spread out and I hike on alone, feeling small and insignificant in this vast space. Namibia\\'s Fish River Canyon is a harsh and beautiful place. Purported to be the second largest of its kind in the world after the Grand Canyon in the US, it measures approximately 160km in length, stretching southwards from Seeheim to the Orange River. The five- or six-day hike that penetrates its base is strenuous, winding through 85km of jaw-dropping scenery from the Hobas viewpoint to the spa resort at Ai-Ais. There is no defined path to follow - trailists have to clamber over boulders, climb embankments and trudge through thick sand or across open plains. There\\'s also no set route - using the map as a guide, you simply follow the river. Furthermore, you need to find the short cuts; if you don\\'t, you\\'ll add many hours of hard slogging to the journey. Nights are spent beneath the stars, with groups finding a flat sandy space and rolling out their sleeping bags. You carry your backpack for five days, so it\\'s vital to be well prepared with the barest essentials. Mine included sachets of tuna, cracker biscuits, instant soup and pasta meals, powdered energy drinks, energy bars and a spare gas canister. Instant oats with raisins and honey would do for breakfast, and I added several slabs of Lindt chocolate. Clothing consisted of a few T-shirts, two pairs each of shorts and underwear, a jersey, a sunhat, a beanie, a sarong and tracksuit pants. My biggest problem was my camera gear, which totals 4kg. After squeezing in cooking equipment, medical supplies, a sleeping bag and an inflatable mattress, I was shocked to find that my pack weighed a hefty 23kg. I became ruthless. Out came half my clothing, a few packets of soup, some energy bars and my lens. The weight registered about 18kg. The chocolate stayed. I wake before dawn and leave Cape Town as a violent thunderstorm breaks over the city. I fetch fellow hiker Julian Abramson and we head along the N7 towards Namibia. Just past Springbok the clouds disperse to reveal a bright, sunny day. At the border we negotiate customs with little fuss, and drive across the Orange River. The sun has just set when we arrive at Ai-Ais, where we rendezvous with the other hikers in our party. Everyone is excited and, after a barbecue, we soak in the hot spring water and chat about our forthcoming adventure. The next morning we take the shuttle bus to Hobas, where we pose on the edge of the canyon for the obligatory team photograph. I slap on some sunscreen, do a few stretches and heave on my pack. We descend the precarious path cautiously, negotiating the rocks with care and using the chains secured at the steeper sections. It\\'s very hot. Unaccustomed to the heavy backpack, my hips are hurting like hell. After two knee-jarring hours I reach the river, strip off my clothes and plunge into the water. Lunch is tuna with crackers, a square of cheese and an energy bar. \"Your pack is now about 250g lighter,\" jokes Abramson. We take a short siesta, then walk in the afternoon heat along the stone-strewn banks of the river. The canyon is so still that the silence is deafening. \"This place is amazing,\" he smiles. \"I sat for a moment and it was so quiet that I could hear the insects talking.\" I trudge on slowly through thick sand and over big boulders, stopping every hour for a swim, until the light softens and we reach a wide sandy bank. I ease the load off my aching back and level out a stretch of sand, then unroll my mattress and sleeping bag. The sun sets and a thin band of pink cloud colours the sky. Dinner is leftover steak and sausages from our barbecue last night, followed by rooibos tea with whisky and honey. Before scrambling into my sleeping bag, I rub my limbs with arnica oil to soothe my sore muscles. Despite being tired, I\\'m entranced by the twinkling stars and dark heavens, and fall asleep lulled by the river gurgling and murmuring around the rocks. Day Two dawns cloudy and after a quick cup of tea we set off downriver. The conditions are ideal for hiking and some of the speedsters in our group rush ahead, leaving us dawdling behind, stopping to swim and take photographs. The first two days are spent covering what is considered to be the most rugged part of the trail as it involves plenty of boulder-hopping and plodding through thick sand. Finding that the left bank has become too steep to negotiate, we make the first of many river crossings. One slip could mean a dunk in the river or even broken bones. I walk on alone, enjoying the silence. Suddenly, amid the barren scenery, white lilies bloom from the earth. Fragile footprints of insects and lizards pattern the sand. The ascending sun illuminates the orange cliffs, then appears overhead, glinting on the green water. After two hours we stop for breakfast and Abramson fires up the Cadac cooker to boil some water. Instant oats have never tasted so good. Trekking on, the going becomes tough as we struggle across long stretches of giant boulders and soft sand. We soon learn to read the canyon by watching the curves of the gorge ahead. I fall into the so-called \"Fish River rhythm\" and the hours fly past. The birdlife is plentiful and we watch two grey herons swoop over the river, their cries echoing off the canyon walls. A booted eagle glides gracefully on the thermals, then suddenly flies off in a frenzy. \"It\\'s being chased by a kestrel that probably has a nest in the area and is protecting its chicks,\" says Meidad Goren, the team\\'s birding expert. Hours later, we stop at a small rocky cove for lunch: chicken noodle soup, tuna with oven-dried tomatoes and a herb dressing, with the usual crackers. By late afternoon we still have not caught up with the frontrunners, and we decide to make camp on a wide beach. I wake early the next morning and check my boots for scorpions before pulling them on. Two of our party set off to try to catch the others. We linger over breakfast until the sun strikes the upper canyon walls. I wash the cutlery with sand and water, then heave on my backpack. It definitely feels lighter today. Soon we encounter the stench of sulphur at Palm Springs, where boiling water gushes from the earth. We spend an hour soaking our limbs, but cannot linger too long or we will fall even further behind. Abramson and I trek on past Klipspringer Ridge and as the peaks of the canyon turn gold, we\\'re treated to the majestic sight of three wild horses drinking from the river. We also spot a large monitor lizard before it vanishes under a rock. The sun disappears and we find a perfect site to spend the night. While collecting firewood, we see three of our companions walking on the opposite riverbank. \"We crossed a little way back but it\\'s too deep here for us to come back over,\" they shout. \"We\\'ll camp further down and meet up with you tomorrow.\" Abramson lights the fire and we relax. \"It doesn\\'t get much better than this,\" he says. \"We\\'re sitting beside a crackling fire, under a starry sky, next to a flowing river, with the horses nearby and pasta cooking on the coals. This is paradise.\" We rendezvous with the others in the morning and find a short cut before scrambling down to yet another river crossing. Shadows creep across the folds of the canyon as the sun lights up the land. We pass Dassie Ridge, then negotiate a series of boulder fields and a vast rocky plain. At last, after a tiring 10-hour slog, we camp below towering Four Finger Rock. After dinner we sit around the fire, toasting marshmallows and listening to the distant cries of baboons and jackals. It\\'s the last day and our small group wakes long before sunrise. We still have 25km of hard hiking ahead to reach Ai-Ais by evening and my feet are taking strain. I\\'ve got four big blisters and every step is agony. Nevertheless, as the sun\\'s rays touch Four Finger Rock, we\\'re ready to go. At a tricky river crossing, a few members of our group slip on the rocks. My blisters are really killing me. Others are also suffering and every break turns into a communal first-aid session. I shut my mind to the pain and hike on doggedly. We finally stumble onto the last short cut at 3pm. There\\'s still 12km to go, but we\\'re on the home stretch and I allow my thoughts to turn to the comforts awaiting us at Ai-Ais - clean clothes, a steak, a cold beer. Crossing the river for the final time, I hobble on for the last few kilometres until, as the light softens and the rocks glow gold, we round a corner and spot the campsite. We dump our packs, order beers and jump into the spa\\'s hot water. Our aches and pains are soon forgotten and we pledge to return to this wilderness of water and stone.\n",

      "\"We don\\'t care about Gucci and Prada. We just want delivery eKasi,\" says a Wesselton resident after four days of heated, violent protests in the township near Ermelo, Mpumalanga. It is Friday morning and he is one of scores of young, unemployed men walking the streets. The anger in his voice is palpable. He spits the words \"Gucci\" and \"Prada\" out, referring to the penchant for fine things ANC politicians have acquired in their years of power. The man, who identifies himself only as Nkosinathi, believes he will probably chastised and perhaps even killed for speaking out against the ruling party. This is Mpumalanga, after all. \"I\\'ve been receiving threats. People are telling me we are on a hit list because we are anti-revolutionary and anti-ANC. We are not anti-ANC. These are the very same issues that confront the communities of other areas. We want decent water, toilets and jobs. But (those other communities) are living in fear.\" Residents of Wesselton say they are no longer afraid. They faced off against police, some of whom used live ammunition, and most have lived to see the next day. One \"comrade\" has died. Solomon Madonsela has become a martyr. What simmers here is an anger that has turned into a resolute decision: we will not accept this; we deserve better. The signs of their struggle are not contained to one section of the sprawling settlement. Destroyed traffic lights, Telkom public phones, burnt containers and the tell-tale black smear left by burnt tyres can be seen throughout the area. Where there are no tyre marks, stones and glass are scattered on the road and pavement. Nkosinathi spends his time with other angry young men. Some would call them militant. They are fiercely political. The call each other \"comrade\" and say they are fierce ANC supporters, but in the same breath vow not to vote for the ruling party - or anyone else - in the upcoming local government elections. Community leader Dumisani Mahaye says he will make the proposal to thee community at a meeting to be held tomorrow. Mahaye says the party, which has a majority of council seats in the Msukaligwa Municipality, should be \"grounded like an errant child\" by communities withholding their endorsement at the polls. \"The ANC has been promising for years. It\\'s been doing that since 1994. But it never lives up to its promises.\" Another \"comrade\" appears and joins the circle, saying the ANC\\'s approach doesn\\'t help, but arguing that the solution cannot be to vandalise state and private property. \"Hasn\\'t the community learnt anything after 15 years? You can voice your anger, but it\\'s wrong to damage property. When we are angry we can\\'t break things that belong to us,\" he says. Some nod in agreement. \"The ANC angers people because it doesn\\'t engage them.\" There is a suggestion that 50 percent of all local jobs be retained for residents, both at the surrounding mines and in the council. The circle is divided - some call for a 70 percent job quota for locals, while others say skills development is what\\'s really needed. Mahaye goes so far as to suggest that councillor salaries be scrapped and that money be used for skills projects. \"People don\\'t work because they are not skilled. Why not take the councillor salaries and build something that will help people? What do the councillors do? People don\\'t see them. Why should they get paid?\" And older resident overhears the debate and offers his opinion. Having lived in Ermelo for more than 40 years, Jeremiah Khumalo is just as frustrated as the young men. His gripe is with a seemingly inefficient and uncaring municipality, which, he says, has ignored a request for technicians to be sent to his home to repair a burst pipe. He takes us to his home, where water can be seen running from a hole in his driveway into the street. He scoops it out to show us the damaged pipe, explaining that he has reported it to at least three different people, including a clerk in the mayor\\'s office. Two months later, water still runs into the street. Several streets away we are shown another property that has lost a large portion of its lawn to a growing body of water. According to homeowner Moses Duma and several neighbours, council workers dug the hole \"and just left it\" in April. Residents say children regularly play in the dirty water after school. Even more disturbing is the electric cabling which runs beneath the hole. Duma says the hole was initially dug to fix a burst pipe. \"They keep promising: they are coming, they are coming. But they don\\'t come.\" His brother Collin emerges from the house and tells us that a child nearly drowned recently. \"The kids like to play in this water. I saw one of them nearly drown but I managed to get them out.\" Municipal spokesman Surprise Ngcongo said last week that the protests \"had nothing to do with service delivery concerns as greatly exaggerated in the mainstream media\". \"Msukaligwa Municipality did not receive any written memorandum from the |angry protesters relating to service delivery concerns.\" However not everyone in Wesselton is a \"comrade\", hellbent on facing off with the state - headed by a previous generation of comrades, who many believe have forgotten their cadres. At the small shopping complex that was the scene of violent clashes with police last week, we find Sibusiso Madi. Beside him are crutches; his foot is in bandages. He is not political, says he was not involved in protests, and just wants to return to work. Madi is one of few residents who are gainfully employed, but today finds himself sharing an uncomfortable set of steps with the many unemployed youngsters who walk the streets of Wesselton. \"I was on my way to work. I was coming to catch my bus over there (he points at a nearby bus shelter). The police didn\\'t ask any questions, they just shot at me. I had to run away.\" What\\'s worse, as a result of the protests, Madi was trapped in the burning township from Monday, when he was shot, until Thursday. \"No ambulance could come in. And the community wouldn\\'t let any cars in. I was prepared to pay R40 for a cab to go to the hospital. But they couldn\\'t come in,\" he says. As a result of the protest, he has lost out on the R1 600 he would have earned in a |fortnight doing construction work on the N17 highway. Selina Ngwenya is also just trying to get by. She sits on a pile of used coal, looking for pieces that can be used. She does not have electricity and uses the coal for cooking. \"Sometimes we spend the whole day doing this. We have to look for pieces that are big.\" She also took part in the protest: \"We want toilets, water and electricity.\" In Khayelihle, a new part of the township, none of the roads are tarred and there are a few green portable toilets in the area. We see about five taps placed throughout the shack settlement, and residents are seen walking back and forth with containers. A group of women, including Sibongile Khosi and Hlezipho Khumalo, complain that the portable toilets are often not collected for two weeks. They also believe the area needs more taps. Will Khosi vote this year? \"I won\\'t vote. Who will I say I\\'m voting for? How long have I been dirtying my ID book with stamps, going to vote? I don\\'t trust anyone.\"\n",

What simmers here is an anger that has turned into a resolute decision: we will not accept this; we deserve better. The signs of their struggle are not contained to one section of the sprawling settlement. Destroyed traffic lights, Telkom public phones, burnt containers and the tell-tale black smear left by burnt tyres can be seen throughout the area. Where there are no tyre marks, stones and glass are scattered on the road and pavement. Nkosinathi spends his time with other angry young men. Some would call them militant. They are fiercely political. The call each other \"comrade\" and say they are fierce ANC supporters, but in the same breath vow not to vote for the ruling party - or anyone else - in the upcoming local government elections. Community leader Dumisani Mahaye says he will make the proposal to thee community at a meeting to be held tomorrow. Mahaye says the party, which has a majority of council seats in the Msukaligwa Municipality, should be \"grounded like an errant child\" by communities withholding their endorsement at the polls. \"The ANC has been promising for years. It\\'s been doing that since 1994. But it never lives up to its promises.\" Another \"comrade\" appears and joins the circle, saying the ANC\\'s approach doesn\\'t help, but arguing that the solution cannot be to vandalise state and private property. \"Hasn\\'t the community learnt anything after 15 years? You can voice your anger, but it\\'s wrong to damage property. When we are angry we can\\'t break things that belong to us,\" he says. Some nod in agreement. \"The ANC angers people because it doesn\\'t engage them.\" There is a suggestion that 50 percent of all local jobs be retained for residents, both at the surrounding mines and in the council. The circle is divided - some call for a 70 percent job quota for locals, while others say skills development is what\\'s really needed. Mahaye goes so far as to suggest that councillor salaries be scrapped and that money be used for skills projects. \"People don\\'t work because they are not skilled. Why not take the councillor salaries and build something that will help people? What do the councillors do? People don\\'t see them. Why should they get paid?\" And older resident overhears the debate and offers his opinion. Having lived in Ermelo for more than 40 years, Jeremiah Khumalo is just as frustrated as the young men. His gripe is with a seemingly inefficient and uncaring municipality, which, he says, has ignored a request for technicians to be sent to his home to repair a burst pipe. He takes us to his home, where water can be seen running from a hole in his driveway into the street. He scoops it out to show us the damaged pipe, explaining that he has reported it to at least three different people, including a clerk in the mayor\\'s office. Two months later, water still runs into the street. Several streets away we are shown another property that has lost a large portion of its lawn to a growing body of water. According to homeowner Moses Duma and several neighbours, council workers dug the hole \"and just left it\" in April. Residents say children regularly play in the dirty water after school. Even more disturbing is the electric cabling which runs beneath the hole. Duma says the hole was initially dug to fix a burst pipe. \"They keep promising: they are coming, they are coming. But they don\\'t come.\" His brother Collin emerges from the house and tells us that a child nearly drowned recently. \"The kids like to play in this water. I saw one of them nearly drown but I managed to get them out.\" Municipal spokesman Surprise Ngcongo said last week that the protests \"had nothing to do with service delivery concerns as greatly exaggerated in the mainstream media\". \"Msukaligwa Municipality did not receive any written memorandum from the |angry protesters relating to service delivery concerns.\" However not everyone in Wesselton is a \"comrade\", hellbent on facing off with the state - headed by a previous generation of comrades, who many believe have forgotten their cadres. At the small shopping complex that was the scene of violent clashes with police last week, we find Sibusiso Madi. Beside him are crutches; his foot is in bandages. He is not political, says he was not involved in protests, and just wants to return to work. Madi is one of few residents who are gainfully employed, but today finds himself sharing an uncomfortable set of steps with the many unemployed youngsters who walk the streets of Wesselton. \"I was on my way to work. I was coming to catch my bus over there (he points at a nearby bus shelter). The police didn\\'t ask any questions, they just shot at me. I had to run away.\" What\\'s worse, as a result of the protests, Madi was trapped in the burning township from Monday, when he was shot, until Thursday. \"No ambulance could come in. And the community wouldn\\'t let any cars in. I was prepared to pay R40 for a cab to go to the hospital. But they couldn\\'t come in,\" he says. As a result of the protest, he has lost out on the R1 600 he would have earned in a |fortnight doing construction work on the N17 highway. Selina Ngwenya is also just trying to get by. She sits on a pile of used coal, looking for pieces that can be used. She does not have electricity and uses the coal for cooking. \"Sometimes we spend the whole day doing this. We have to look for pieces that are big.\" She also took part in the protest: \"We want toilets, water and electricity.\" In Khayelihle, a new part of the township, none of the roads are tarred and there are a few green portable toilets in the area. We see about five taps placed throughout the shack settlement, and residents are seen walking back and forth with containers. A group of women, including Sibongile Khosi and Hlezipho Khumalo, complain that the portable toilets are often not collected for two weeks. They also believe the area needs more taps. Will Khosi vote this year? \"I won\\'t vote. Who will I say I\\'m voting for? How long have I been dirtying my ID book with stamps, going to vote? I don\\'t trust anyone.\"\n",

      "Dropped Article 18:\n",
      "It\\'s serenely silent as I hike down the canyon walls. The only sounds are the crunch of my boots on the boulders, the occasional twitter of a bird and the gentle tumbling of the river. High above, towering orange cliffs loom, outlined against the deep blue sky. It\\'s a hot morning, so I stop for a swim. The cold water refreshes me instantly and I linger, soothing my muscles. Our group is spread out and I hike on alone, feeling small and insignificant in this vast space. Namibia\\'s Fish River Canyon is a harsh and beautiful place. Purported to be the second largest of its kind in the world after the Grand Canyon in the US, it measures approximately 160km in length, stretching southwards from Seeheim to the Orange River. The five- or six-day hike that penetrates its base is strenuous, winding through 85km of jaw-dropping scenery from the Hobas viewpoint to the spa resort at Ai-Ais. There is no defined path to follow - trailists have to clamber over boulders, climb embankments and trudge through thick sand or across open plains. There\\'s also no set route - using the map as a guide, you simply follow the river. Furthermore, you need to find the short cuts; if you don\\'t, you\\'ll add many hours of hard slogging to the journey. Nights are spent beneath the stars, with groups finding a flat sandy space and rolling out their sleeping bags. You carry your backpack for five days, so it\\'s vital to be well prepared with the barest essentials. Mine included sachets of tuna, cracker biscuits, instant soup and pasta meals, powdered energy drinks, energy bars and a spare gas canister. Instant oats with raisins and honey would do for breakfast, and I added several slabs of Lindt chocolate. Clothing consisted of a few T-shirts, two pairs each of shorts and underwear, a jersey, a sunhat, a beanie, a sarong and tracksuit pants. My biggest problem was my camera gear, which totals 4kg. After squeezing in cooking equipment, medical supplies, a sleeping bag and an inflatable mattress, I was shocked to find that my pack weighed a hefty 23kg. I became ruthless. Out came half my clothing, a few packets of soup, some energy bars and my lens. The weight registered about 18kg. The chocolate stayed. I wake before dawn and leave Cape Town as a violent thunderstorm breaks over the city. I fetch fellow hiker Julian Abramson and we head along the N7 towards Namibia. Just past Springbok the clouds disperse to reveal a bright, sunny day. At the border we negotiate customs with little fuss, and drive across the Orange River. The sun has just set when we arrive at Ai-Ais, where we rendezvous with the other hikers in our party. Everyone is excited and, after a barbecue, we soak in the hot spring water and chat about our forthcoming adventure. The next morning we take the shuttle bus to Hobas, where we pose on the edge of the canyon for the obligatory team photograph. I slap on some sunscreen, do a few stretches and heave on my pack. We descend the precarious path cautiously, negotiating the rocks with care and using the chains secured at the steeper sections. It\\'s very hot. Unaccustomed to the heavy backpack, my hips are hurting like hell. After two knee-jarring hours I reach the river, strip off my clothes and plunge into the water. Lunch is tuna with crackers, a square of cheese and an energy bar. \"Your pack is now about 250g lighter,\" jokes Abramson. We take a short siesta, then walk in the afternoon heat along the stone-strewn banks of the river. The canyon is so still that the silence is deafening. \"This place is amazing,\" he smiles. \"I sat for a moment and it was so quiet that I could hear the insects talking.\" I trudge on slowly through thick sand and over big boulders, stopping every hour for a swim, until the light softens and we reach a wide sandy bank. I ease the load off my aching back and level out a stretch of sand, then unroll my mattress and sleeping bag. The sun sets and a thin band of pink cloud colours the sky. Dinner is leftover steak and sausages from our barbecue last night, followed by rooibos tea with whisky and honey. Before scrambling into my sleeping bag, I rub my limbs with arnica oil to soothe my sore muscles. Despite being tired, I\\'m entranced by the twinkling stars and dark heavens, and fall asleep lulled by the river gurgling and murmuring around the rocks. Day Two dawns cloudy and after a quick cup of tea we set off downriver. The conditions are ideal for hiking and some of the speedsters in our group rush ahead, leaving us dawdling behind, stopping to swim and take photographs. The first two days are spent covering what is considered to be the most rugged part of the trail as it involves plenty of boulder-hopping and plodding through thick sand. Finding that the left bank has become too steep to negotiate, we make the first of many river crossings. One slip could mean a dunk in the river or even broken bones. I walk on alone, enjoying the silence. Suddenly, amid the barren scenery, white lilies bloom from the earth. Fragile footprints of insects and lizards pattern the sand. The ascending sun illuminates the orange cliffs, then appears overhead, glinting on the green water. After two hours we stop for breakfast and Abramson fires up the Cadac cooker to boil some water. Instant oats have never tasted so good. Trekking on, the going becomes tough as we struggle across long stretches of giant boulders and soft sand. We soon learn to read the canyon by watching the curves of the gorge ahead. I fall into the so-called \"Fish River rhythm\" and the hours fly past. The birdlife is plentiful and we watch two grey herons swoop over the river, their cries echoing off the canyon walls. A booted eagle glides gracefully on the thermals, then suddenly flies off in a frenzy. \"It\\'s being chased by a kestrel that probably has a nest in the area and is protecting its chicks,\" says Meidad Goren, the team\\'s birding expert. Hours later, we stop at a small rocky cove for lunch: chicken noodle soup, tuna with oven-dried tomatoes and a herb dressing, with the usual crackers. By late afternoon we still have not caught up with the frontrunners, and we decide to make camp on a wide beach. I wake early the next morning and check my boots for scorpions before pulling them on. Two of our party set off to try to catch the others. We linger over breakfast until the sun strikes the upper canyon walls. I wash the cutlery with sand and water, then heave on my backpack. It definitely feels lighter today. Soon we encounter the stench of sulphur at Palm Springs, where boiling water gushes from the earth. We spend an hour soaking our limbs, but cannot linger too long or we will fall even further behind. Abramson and I trek on past Klipspringer Ridge and as the peaks of the canyon turn gold, we\\'re treated to the majestic sight of three wild horses drinking from the river. We also spot a large monitor lizard before it vanishes under a rock. The sun disappears and we find a perfect site to spend the night. While collecting firewood, we see three of our companions walking on the opposite riverbank. \"We crossed a little way back but it\\'s too deep here for us to come back over,\" they shout. \"We\\'ll camp further down and meet up with you tomorrow.\" Abramson lights the fire and we relax. \"It doesn\\'t get much better than this,\" he says. \"We\\'re sitting beside a crackling fire, under a starry sky, next to a flowing river, with the horses nearby and pasta cooking on the coals. This is paradise.\" We rendezvous with the others in the morning and find a short cut before scrambling down to yet another river crossing. Shadows creep across the folds of the canyon as the sun lights up the land. We pass Dassie Ridge, then negotiate a series of boulder fields and a vast rocky plain. At last, after a tiring 10-hour slog, we camp below towering Four Finger Rock. After dinner we sit around the fire, toasting marshmallows and listening to the distant cries of baboons and jackals. It\\'s the last day and our small group wakes long before sunrise. We still have 25km of hard hiking ahead to reach Ai-Ais by evening and my feet are taking strain. I\\'ve got four big blisters and every step is agony. Nevertheless, as the sun\\'s rays touch Four Finger Rock, we\\'re ready to go. At a tricky river crossing, a few members of our group slip on the rocks. My blisters are really killing me. Others are also suffering and every break turns into a communal first-aid session. I shut my mind to the pain and hike on doggedly. We finally stumble onto the last short cut at 3pm. There\\'s still 12km to go, but we\\'re on the home stretch and I allow my thoughts to turn to the comforts awaiting us at Ai-Ais - clean clothes, a steak, a cold beer. Crossing the river for the final time, I hobble on for the last few kilometres until, as the light softens and the rocks glow gold, we round a corner and spot the campsite. We dump our packs, order beers and jump into the spa\\'s hot water. Our aches and pains are soon forgotten and we pledge to return to this wilderness of water and stone.\n",

      "\"We don\\'t care about Gucci and Prada. We just want delivery eKasi,\" says a Wesselton resident after four days of heated, violent protests in the township near Ermelo, Mpumalanga. It is Friday morning and he is one of scores of young, unemployed men walking the streets. The anger in his voice is palpable. He spits the words \"Gucci\" and \"Prada\" out, referring to the penchant for fine things ANC politicians have acquired in their years of power. The man, who identifies himself only as Nkosinathi, believes he will probably chastised and perhaps even killed for speaking out against the ruling party. This is Mpumalanga, after all. \"I\\'ve been receiving threats. People are telling me we are on a hit list because we are anti-revolutionary and anti-ANC. We are not anti-ANC. These are the very same issues that confront the communities of other areas. We want decent water, toilets and jobs. But (those other communities) are living in fear.\" Residents of Wesselton say they are no longer afraid. They faced off against police, some of whom used live ammunition, and most have lived to see the next day. One \"comrade\" has died. Solomon Madonsela has become a martyr. What simmers here is an anger that has turned into a resolute decision: we will not accept this; we deserve better. The signs of their struggle are not contained to one section of the sprawling settlement. Destroyed traffic lights, Telkom public phones, burnt containers and the tell-tale black smear left by burnt tyres can be seen throughout the area. Where there are no tyre marks, stones and glass are scattered on the road and pavement. Nkosinathi spends his time with other angry young men. Some would call them militant. They are fiercely political. The call each other \"comrade\" and say they are fierce ANC supporters, but in the same breath vow not to vote for the ruling party - or anyone else - in the upcoming local government elections. Community leader Dumisani Mahaye says he will make the proposal to thee community at a meeting to be held tomorrow. Mahaye says the party, which has a majority of council seats in the Msukaligwa Municipality, should be \"grounded like an errant child\" by communities withholding their endorsement at the polls. \"The ANC has been promising for years. It\\'s been doing that since 1994. But it never lives up to its promises.\" Another \"comrade\" appears and joins the circle, saying the ANC\\'s approach doesn\\'t help, but arguing that the solution cannot be to vandalise state and private property. \"Hasn\\'t the community learnt anything after 15 years? You can voice your anger, but it\\'s wrong to damage property. When we are angry we can\\'t break things that belong to us,\" he says. Some nod in agreement. \"The ANC angers people because it doesn\\'t engage them.\" There is a suggestion that 50 percent of all local jobs be retained for residents, both at the surrounding mines and in the council. The circle is divided - some call for a 70 percent job quota for locals, while others say skills development is what\\'s really needed. Mahaye goes so far as to suggest that councillor salaries be scrapped and that money be used for skills projects. \"People don\\'t work because they are not skilled. Why not take the councillor salaries and build something that will help people? What do the councillors do? People don\\'t see them. Why should they get paid?\" And older resident overhears the debate and offers his opinion. Having lived in Ermelo for more than 40 years, Jeremiah Khumalo is just as frustrated as the young men. His gripe is with a seemingly inefficient and uncaring municipality, which, he says, has ignored a request for technicians to be sent to his home to repair a burst pipe. He takes us to his home, where water can be seen running from a hole in his driveway into the street. He scoops it out to show us the damaged pipe, explaining that he has reported it to at least three different people, including a clerk in the mayor\\'s office. Two months later, water still runs into the street. Several streets away we are shown another property that has lost a large portion of its lawn to a growing body of water. According to homeowner Moses Duma and several neighbours, council workers dug the hole \"and just left it\" in April. Residents say children regularly play in the dirty water after school. Even more disturbing is the electric cabling which runs beneath the hole. Duma says the hole was initially dug to fix a burst pipe. \"They keep promising: they are coming, they are coming. But they don\\'t come.\" His brother Collin emerges from the house and tells us that a child nearly drowned recently. \"The kids like to play in this water. I saw one of them nearly drown but I managed to get them out.\" Municipal spokesman Surprise Ngcongo said last week that the protests \"had nothing to do with service delivery concerns as greatly exaggerated in the mainstream media\". \"Msukaligwa Municipality did not receive any written memorandum from the |angry protesters relating to service delivery concerns.\" However not everyone in Wesselton is a \"comrade\", hellbent on facing off with the state - headed by a previous generation of comrades, who many believe have forgotten their cadres. At the small shopping complex that was the scene of violent clashes with police last week, we find Sibusiso Madi. Beside him are crutches; his foot is in bandages. He is not political, says he was not involved in protests, and just wants to return to work. Madi is one of few residents who are gainfully employed, but today finds himself sharing an uncomfortable set of steps with the many unemployed youngsters who walk the streets of Wesselton. \"I was on my way to work. I was coming to catch my bus over there (he points at a nearby bus shelter). The police didn\\'t ask any questions, they just shot at me. I had to run away.\" What\\'s worse, as a result of the protests, Madi was trapped in the burning township from Monday, when he was shot, until Thursday. \"No ambulance could come in. And the community wouldn\\'t let any cars in. I was prepared to pay R40 for a cab to go to the hospital. But they couldn\\'t come in,\" he says. As a result of the protest, he has lost out on the R1 600 he would have earned in a |fortnight doing construction work on the N17 highway. Selina Ngwenya is also just trying to get by. She sits on a pile of used coal, looking for pieces that can be used. She does not have electricity and uses the coal for cooking. \"Sometimes we spend the whole day doing this. We have to look for pieces that are big.\" She also took part in the protest: \"We want toilets, water and electricity.\" In Khayelihle, a new part of the township, none of the roads are tarred and there are a few green portable toilets in the area. We see about five taps placed throughout the shack settlement, and residents are seen walking back and forth with containers. A group of women, including Sibongile Khosi and Hlezipho Khumalo, complain that the portable toilets are often not collected for two weeks. They also believe the area needs more taps. Will Khosi vote this year? \"I won\\'t vote. Who will I say I\\'m voting for? How long have I been dirtying my ID book with stamps, going to vote? I don\\'t trust anyone.\"\n",

      "IF our national flower is the protea and our national sport is soccerâ€¦ I mean rugby (hey, you guys can fight it out, I prefer boules), our national meat has to be lamb. Whether it\\'s cooked on the braai, on the spit or in a potjie, roasted in the oven, turned into sosaties, a Durban curry or a Cape Malay breyani, it\\'s the one meat that unites our dark carnivorous hearts. You can cook it slowly and thoroughly or quickly and rare. Lamb was on the menu at two launches recently. One was a new theatre restaurant, the other a regular summer spitbraai on a wine farm. Both were in rather posh if very different surroundings. The spitbraai happens every Sunday from 11.30am till sunset at AllÃ©e Bleue, at the intersection of the R45 and R310 near Franschhoek. There\\'s live music, tables with umbrellas on the lawns in front of the farm\\'s manor house, and an interior with a large table laid out with beautifully arranged plates of starters and salads and, later on, a dessert buffet. The beast is cooked in a stainless steel coffin which is the modern version of the old-fashioned spit suspended over coals out in the open for people to watch while the animal slowly turned, with regular basting. Now it happens out of sight, but I\\'ve been to such spitbraais and been fascinated to see how well it all turns out. At the stylish if sterile affair at AllÃ©e Bleue, it\\'s all sophisticated and precise. This is the well-shod, highbrow incarnation of the spitbraai, and there is clearly a market for it. I\\'d prefer something a tad more rustic where you can see the beast turning over the coals. The starter spread was lovely. Compact terrines of salmon or cheeses, crisp salads. The desserts were great - lots of fresh fruit, individual chocolate mousses, miniature pavlovas and tiramisu. There were good vegetable accompaniments, but the portions of meat - you file past chefs who serve for you - were minuscule. One chef told me they had been expecting about 40 people that day so had cooked only half a lamb. Hey, they\\'re only lambs. Two legs, two shoulders, a couple of shanks and a few ribs and they\\'re all but gone. But they tasted great and there were other meats. Having said that, give AllÃ©e Bleue\\'s spitbraais a try. The price is reasonable - R175 a head for a whole day out including a three-course meal and entertainment. On to the Theatre on the Bay in Camps Bay, where Andrea and Oscar Foulkes of Dish Food & Social have taken over the upstairs restaurant, now renamed Side Dish and serving a small menu of dishes that are good and manageable, given that everyone who dines there is going to a show not long after sitting down to dinner. It\\'s clear as you sit down that the staff know that time is key and need to get your orders on the go without wasting any time. That this happens while also serving you lovely grub, beautifully presented and with a great choice of wines (also speedily served) makes for a perfect dining experience within these precise parameters. What you don\\'t need in a theatre restaurant is lots of choice. Side Dish offers just three starters, three mains and three desserts, with one extra optional side salad. There are also specials of the day. The starters on the night were grilled prawns with parsley, garlic and chilli, tossed with linguine and lemon butter; Shanghai duck salad with watercress, mango, mint and green apple dressing, and caramelised pear and gorgonzola salad with peppery leaves, croutons and a pomegranate dressing. We ordered the last two, both of which were beautifully fresh and light. Mains were shoulder of lamb with caramelised garlic mashed potato, green beans, baby corn and a red wine jus; truffle-scented sautÃ©ed gnocchi with mushrooms, beetroot confit and fine beans with almond cream; and grilled linefish with potato croquettes, carrot and ginger purÃ©e, mangetout and gremolata dressing. The slow-cooked lamb dish was deeply flavourful and moreish. The gnocchi tasted good and were in a pleasant sauce but the gnocchi themselves did not hold their shape. Desserts were vanilla crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with pistachio biscotti, dark chocolate tart with hazelnut ice-cream and berry compote, and black cherry cheesecake with chocolate ganache. This being a launch, they served miniature versions of these in the new top-floor VIP room at the interval. The brÃ»lÃ©es were stupendously good, the chocolate tarts as chocolatey as you could hope for. The little cheesecakes were never going to compete with a brÃ»lÃ©e and anything containing lots of chocolate. A perfect way to set yourself up for the ridiculous amount of laughing you\\'ll be doing if you\\'re going to see the wildly funny Fascinating Aida. An entire lamb on the spit would scarcely be enough to fortify you for this trio\\'s relentless wit. l AllÃ©e Bleue, R45/R310 junction, between Paarl and Franschhoek 021 874 1021 l Side Dish, Theatre on the Bay, Camps Bay 021 438 3300 l Read more of Tony Jackman\\'s food writing atwww.sliver.co.za\n",

But who will feel sorry for a fool who hauls hot coals over his own head. All talk about not being scared of a disciplinary hearing is empty rhetoric. Malema claims he cares about unity in the ANC, but his actions over the past three years tell a totally different story. Take his attacks on alliance partners like Cosatu and the SACP and his divisive singling out of Gwede Mantashe for slander and disrespect. Malema has created a gulf of suspicion between those in Government and those based at Luthuli house. He even tried to cause division in the Presidency by lobbying Kgalema Motlanthe to stand against President Zuma. Malema and company fully deserve what is coming their way.

      "The train rattles into platform 11 at Park Station. As a young child I grab on to my mother\\'s dress and hold on tight. My mother picks me up and we float into a coach packed with people singing hymns; going home to coal fires over Dover stoves. This memory loiters in my mind as I come to realise that the image of the train is a metaphor of dislocation and an agent of an exile of sorts. Our mothers, kitchen girls, were exiled from us when they went to work. Our fathers, migrants, were exiled from the homelands, spending most of their time away from their wives and their lovely children. This is part of a reality that Zwelidumile Feni had to face in a way. This is also a reality for many like him who jumped oceans escaping from the claws of a system we all know they had to face. This was never a choice for them, that much they will admit. But because they were prey to an animal that seeked to engulf, overpower and destroy them, they had to jump ship. Directed by Ramadan Suleman, who wrote it with Bheki Peterson, Zwelidumile invites the viewer into the complex world of exile. We follow the journey of Dumile\\'s daughter finding her father through interviews with friends and colleagues. The personal struggles of the exiled are brought to the fore with the use of thematic intertextuality and what appears to be complex multiduplicity. It is often said of documentaries of this nature that they are made primarily to be historiographies or biographies of their subjects. But this film transcends this notion, in that one gets a sense that the participants also figure out what it means for them to be in exile and to be exiled from their loved ones through talking about Dumile Feni. One could say that through their interviews they travel through memory; to rediscover what it meant for them to be in exile. In many ways, as one of the interviewees remarked, his art was congruent and inseparable from his life. In the way that his biographical narrative is told, this congruency is artistically and skilfully executed in cinematographic terms. Through the film, we discover the many faces of the man Dumile Feni. We get to feel and see the pain, the hardships and suffering that many like him had to endure. We get to realise that exile was not what we imagined it to be, or what those who did not know told us it was and what we articulated it to be, but that for some it was worse than what they had left behind. It was for many like him a personal struggle to survive and constantly hold on or forget histories, relationships and other parts that reminded them of home. In closing, I leave you with this comment, a comment that the man himself made quoted by Barney Simon in an article titled \"Dumile\", in |The Classic, Vol 2, No 4, 1968: \"One day I was in the township with this driver and we went past a line of men who were all handcuffed. I don\\'t know what for, maybe for having no pass or something. Anyway the driver said: \\'Why don\\'t you ever draw things like that?\\' \"I didn\\'t know what to say. Then just when I was still thinking, a funeral for a child came past. A funeral on a Monday morning. You know, all the people in black on a lorry. And as the funeral went past those men in handcuffs, those men watched it go past, and those with hats took off their hats. I said to the guy I was with: \\'That\\'s what I want to draw!\\'\" l The documentary was shown at the Tricontinental Film Festival last year.

      "Fikile Mbalula loves a good speech and his statement on the findings and recommendations of the Nicholson report into Cricket SA\\'s administrative ills opened thus: \"The Director-General of Sport and Recreation South Africa; Mr Alec Moemi; Ladies and gentlemen of the media; Fellow South Africans and sports-loving people â€¦\" A good start. \"Things being equal, today would have been an ideal day for all of us to be following Super Rugby, the build-up to the Pirates-Chiefs derby, the cricket Test between SA and New Zealand from our TV screens in the comfort of our own living rooms, or from the grandstands of our magnificent stadiums. How-ever, circumstances beyond our control have conspired and dictated that we converge here this morning to set up a remedy for the cancer diagnosed by the Ministerial Committee of enquiry into the affairs of CricketSouth Africa. These circumstances are a constant reminder that there can be no normal sport under abnormal circumstances.\" Gosh. No normal sport under abnormal circumstances, Chiefs, Pirates, Super Rugby, cancer, magnificent stadiums and the SA tour to New Zealand in one breath. Mbalula\\'s answers to the questions that followed showed that he is not in the least bit afraid of using a bad clichÃ© when he has to. \"I\\'ll cross the bridge when I get there. I don\\'t want to put the cart before the horse. I have not consulted a sangoma,\" he said, then followed that with \"either you go to heaven or you go to hell\". Fikile saved his best for last, though, when he dipped into his treasure chest of phrases from his days as the ANC Youth League president when he said that the ministry and the government would not stand for any \"insurrectionary fear mongering\" from anyone. Ah, said the journalists as they scribbled those three words down. What the hell does that mean? A few hacks chucked it into their copy to see what their subs would make of it. Expect to see those words used as a term of endearment or a joke in the near future. Kass Naidoo, CSA\\'s brand and corporate communications manager, resigned yesterday. There was some praise for her finally taking the step, some criticism that she had not done it sooner, and, from a good handful of former and present sponsors, suppliers and contractors of CSA, much celebration. It is well known that Naidoo\\'s relationship with some of the sponsors had been frosty, to say the least. The questions Injury Time were often asked by sponsors when speaking about Naidoo were: \"How has she still got a job?\", \"What exactly does she do?\" She had tried to haul at least one sponsor\\'s representatives over the coals after they had disagreed with her decision to turn down a request that they, and the media, had put to her. The boss of the representative in question told her in no uncertain terms that they were sponsors and she was the client, and that they would not be discussing the matter any further with her. Last year she invited each of the print journos to come to her office to talk about the image of CSA, and to ask them to be honest with her. She knew she was in trouble back then. Naidoo was also responsible for trying to impose accreditation conditions on the print media that were draconian and restricted them from doing their jobs. On several occasions Sanef, the national editors forum, rejected the conditions and were forced to go to CEO Majola. Had they not, newspapers and agencies would not have reported on the sport from the stadiums. Naidoo announced her resignation via her facebook page, with the headline \"Kass Naidoo tenders resignation to Cricket SA\". Then she bylined it: \"Statement by Kass Naidoo.\" That\\'s a bit like Injury Time writing about Injury Time, which we try not to do even though we love ourselves a lot more than we really should. But this isn\\'t about us, just as cricket wasn\\'t about Kass Naidoo. It really was time she left.\n",

      "Isupport the roasting of celebrities - I just wasn\\'t aware we had any celebrities to roast. How can we be tearing down people whom we refuse to put on a pedestal? The roasting tradition is not actually one of ours - it is a peculiar American ritual that has, like many others, been imported to South Africa to give local flavour to another imported television channel/series. Comedy Central (DStv) is responsible for transplanting this American custom here, and Steve Hofmeyr was the subject of the first local roast this week. It had already been the talk of the town, splashed across newspapers for days after the recording took place at Gold Reef City in Joburg. Rather absurdly, the recording was turned into a social event by a band of hard-working and persistent publicists. There could not have been much going on in Joburg that week, for it\\'s hard to believe the roasting of Hofmeyr would be deemed such an occasion. Did it really warrant the amount of news coverage it attracted? If anything, the event proved how easy it is to manipulate the media. As Hofmeyr is such a controversial figure, he was the carrot that was dangled. Hofmeyr is the ideal target for a roast. He is cheesy, parades the kind of confidence (read arrogance) that you want to see deflated, and has carved out a position for himself as what some term a \"borderline racist\" (whatever that means). This is the man who went to pay his respects to Eugene Terre\\'Blanche at his funeral, and during the hate-speech trial, threatened to sing a song including the k-word if the court permitted Julius Malema, then-ANC Youth League president, to sing Dubul\\' iBhunu (Shoot the Boer). This was after dumping his tickets to see the Irish band U2 after a favourable comment Bono was supposed to have made about the above-mentioned song - it later transpired that Bono\\'s observation had been misconstrued. Hofmeyr is like a recurring boil; you forget about him when he isn\\'t around but when he emerges, fuelling the flames of the fires, you want to see him lanced. The only problem with engineering a situation for a public kind of lancing, such as a roast, is that while the roasters work hard at undermining the credibility of their target, many are chosen because they are old chums, and they quickly slip into paying tribute. I have watched enough American roasts to know that while this ritual has been engineered to allow roasters to air that celebrity\\'s misdemeanours - flaunt them, even - at heart this event is a tribute. It is an affirmation that even though they are hugely famous, they are infallible. It also works as a kind of cleansing ritual. I am thinking here about the roast of Charlie Sheen who, like Hofmeyr, has his fair share of dirty laundry. There was a sense that the Hollywood set at his roast were there to appraise him of all his wrongs before setting him free from them. Someone might as well have told him to say three hail Mary\\'s - as per the Catholic tradition. The only problem with the roast functioning as a kind of moral cleansing ceremony is that roastees don\\'t ask for forgiveness, nor do they usually admit to any wrongdoing - though on some level, the fact that they agree to take part in this bizarre practice suggests they are seeking absolution, the kind that reinforces their celebrity position. And this is precisely what occurred during the Hofmeyr roast; he opened himself up, but only to direct attention to his celebrity status. As Hofmeyr observed at the end, he didn\\'t exactly get much of a roasting. If you had to stick to the culinary analogy you could say he was lightly sautÃ©ed in butter. This probably had something to do with the fact that SA doesn\\'t have a culture of roasting - and I mean satire. You can count the number of bona fide satirists here on one hand, and at least three of them have been sued by President Jacob Zuma. It\\'s not surprising that Hofmeyr only got a light sautÃ©eing, given that Minki van der Westhuizen was one of the roasters. Of course, the roasters themselves are carefully selected as easy targets for a bit of light roasting, too. Hence Casper de Vries and Kuli Roberts were part of the team. However, I struggled to crack a smile. The humour was lame, uninventive and certainly not sharp or deep enough to warrant the roasting appellation. Perhaps we will get better at satire as time passes and the roast evolves into something to fit our idiosyncratic context, where even the notion of a celebrity doesn\\'t carry much weight. Maybe we could call our own derivative of this American ritual a braai. I can think of a number of people who could do with a few turns over the coals - Eric Miyeni, David Bullardâ€¦ We have a long queue of people deemed by the media \"borderline racists\" just begging for a basting.\n",

It doesn\\'t take ages to get to - especially important if you are going for two nights and don\\'t feel like having half your time out being taken up by driving, so it is an ideal short bush getaway - and I also like the fact that it\\'s malaria-free. Whatever debates or reservations you have about taking malaria tablets, when you go to Madikwe these are moot. And that\\'s a big plus in my book. We had two nights booked at Jaci\\'s Tree Top Lodge, a place that sounds romantic in the extreme and is billed as being more intimate than the nearby sister lodge Jaci\\'s Safari Lodge. Each rather large tree house - a combination of canvas and brick - is built on stilts and curves around trees. Bathrooms are open-plan - as so many are in high-end lodges these days - but there\\'s a quaintly named \"modesty curtain\" that you can use, whether you\\'re with a romantic partner or not. Everything\\'s delightfully tree-themed, from the twin basins to a \"jungle\" shower, too cold for our use at the tail end of winter, alas. I loved the heater in the toilet, nice touch that, and we were kept warm with electric blankets and heaters. Due to safety reasons, the fireplaces in the tree houses were taken away - pity, as that would have lent an additional romantic touch. I also missed not having tea-and coffee-making facilities in the room and having to walk to the main reception to get a cuppa - but that\\'s a small quibble. You wake to mornings watching the trees dance delicately against the biscuit-coloured blinds as well as the usual cacophony of jungle noises. Foregoing an early morning, we indulged in the opportuinty to relax. A breakfast/brunch is served near 11am, and you can choose to have a traditional English breakfast and an assortment of yoghurts and other continental delights, or plunge straight into a more lunchified menu of stir fry one day and lasagne and salad the next. Another nice touch, and something I haven\\'t encountered in other lodges. Staying true to the theme of leisure after a usual frantic week, we took our time and then took off along a path linking the Tree Top Lodge to the Safari Lodge. Another unusual touch - in many of these lodges you are prohibited from leaving camp, and understandably, wild beasts roam there, but it is good to get out and stretch your legs a little. The Safari Lodge comes as an unexpected surprise after the more tree-ified Tree Tops. Here, you will find a large lounge reception area decked out in bright fuchsias and other bright colours, several nooks where you can chat or bring out your laptop and be quiet and alone with your thoughts. Plus a large fire pit in the middle of the lounge with a circle of cushions around it - I could imagine a large group of friends holding marshmallows over the coals and shooting the breeze. Rooms in this lodge are more stone and brick and overlook the Marico River. There\\'s also a suite that sleeps eight to 10 people and has a braai area - appealing again, if you are in a large group. At the open air gym area, I slipped my hands into boxing gloves and released some tension. There\\'s also a spa if you like release of a different kind. It\\'s very child-friendly, with a games room for the little ones. But what really got my imagination spinning and playing was spending time in the hide overlooking the river. Romantic fantasies aside, the hide has a lovely double- bed if you want to spend the night out of doors - although the cold deterred us, a part of me flirted with the idea. But by day it\\'s a place for lodge visitors to sit and chill and watch the numbers of game that come to drink and cavort at the river. While we were there a large family of elephants with babies of various sizes came to drink, play, stamp up a few bursts of dust in jest - or not - and amble through the bush. Antelope came prancing by to drink, and we swopped reminisces of other times in the bush with other visitors, as you do when you\\'re away. There\\'s something about the hide that encourages talk, and I was moved to hear of a man\\'s journey to the lodge, with his two children, after his wife died some months ago. There\\'s also healing out there, among the sadness, and you can only wish sympathy, empathy and healing. But the bush is also about the game drive, and there\\'s something strangely soothing and also healing in heading out into nature, watching as the sun dips, and for a few moments there\\'s that magical \"sweet light\" where every photo is tinged by something goldenly magical as the light shines on a group of zebra, turning in unison, as though instructed somehow to pose for photos. While Friday night\\'s dinner had been a plated affair - beef and duck - Saturday night\\'s supper was served outside around roaring fires and consisted of potjiekos and lamb chops and vegetables. We huddled in blankets - the days were brightly hot for the end of winter, but the chill came out at night. Stars glimmered brightly as we tucked into peppermint tart to round off the meal. For me, a trip to the bush is also about being out in nature, and I love bush walks. None had been booked, but another regular guest let us know that these could be arranged and so it was, within a short time. It is special walking in the bush with large animals around, with almost a sense of danger. Of course, most animals sense and see you long before you will ever see them - and most do keep away. Walking in the bush is more about looking at the little things you would not see during a game drive - from spoor to dung trails to trees arching nakedly into the sky. It\\'s also about walking quietly through what is mostly an alien landscape for so many - hearing the twittering of birds, and the far-off cackles and barks of the animals in the distance. It\\'s a time to reflect, make memories, peel off some of the city\\'s abrasiveness. And to wonder what it might be like to spend months surrounded by sky and bush and grass, and having no agenda beyond simply being. lArja Salafranca was a guest of Jaci\\'s Tree Tops Lodge Book time away at Jaci\\'s Safari Lodge or Tree Trops Lodge, or if you\\'d like to hone your photographic skills, take part in the workshops. They are given by Roger and Pat de la Harpe. The dates are November|18-21, 2012 - intermediate workshop; January 13-16, 2013 - intermediate workshop.

      "Gary Kirsten\\'s response to a question about transformation perhaps being behind his decision not to renew his contract as the national side\\'s coach, drew a curt response. \"No. I\\'ve given my reasons and those are 100 percent what my reasons are,\" he said on Friday. The transformation of the national side remains a contentious issue. The squad for the Champions Trophy contains just two black African players, and more than two decades on from South Africa\\'s return from sport isolation, there are many people within South African cricket and outside of it who believe the sport has failed on transformation. Kirsten was drawn into the issue following the tour to Australia last year when Thami Tsolekile complained about a lack of clarity on his future in the national side. Tsolekile said Kirsten had been very clear about his stance - that he was AB de Villiers\\'s back-up in the Test side - but there were many outside of the national side who believed Kirsten could have done more to push transformation of the South African side. A meeting was held during the first Test with New Zealand in Cape Town in January where Kirsten and selection convener Andrew Hudson were asked by the then stand-in chief executive, Jacques Faul, to clear up the Tsolekile matter before Hudson was later hauled over the coals by the previous CSA Board. Meetings like the one in Cape Town didn\\'t happen often - Kirsten was largely allowed time to coach the national side - but they would have served as a reminder to him that besides the pressures of achieving results there were other issues also crucial to the agenda of South African cricket, and transformation was foremost among those. Ultimately however, the amount of time away from home proved too much for Kirsten, who throughout his tenure as coach spelled out the importance of returning home and being a dad to his three children - all aged under 10. Ironically, it was the last few weeks at home which ultimately made up his mind for him. \"I feel I can no longer cope with the lengthy periods of separation from my family that this job demands,\" he said on Friday. \"I believe that my responsibilities as a father and to my family are being compromised. \"I\\'ve just had five weeks at home now, which is the longest period I\\'ve had at home for a number of years, and I began to realise what my absence as a father (was doing) and what effect it has had on my family.\" Under Kirsten\\'s guidance, a South African side which had touched success only briefly in 2008/09, finally began to realise just how good they were and established themselves as the best Test team in the world. South Africa won six out of seven Test series\\' in the two years Kirsten was in charge, drawing only his first series as coach with Australia in 2011. In 19 Tests in that time, they lost just twice and the highlights of his tenure would have to be the tours to England and Australia. South Africa sit securely atop the Test rankings, though their position will be challenged next season when India and Australia tour here. The limited overs formats were a lot less successful. There certainly didn\\'t appear to be much of a plan with the T20 side. They lost all their Super Six games at the World T20 Championships in Sri Lanka last year - and last season saw Kirsten hand over responsibility for that unit to his now replacement Russell Domingo. The one-day team also lacks the consistency of its Test cousin - SA won only 13 of 24 ODIs during Kirsten\\'s coaching tenure - and a feeling persists that no proper plan exists for the World Cup, which is now less than two years away. The strategising for that event now falls firmly in Domingo\\'s lap. Kirsten\\'s two-year stint as coach will be remembered for the heights that South Africa reached, but more importantly it was the emphasis he placed on the players to grow as people, to look beyond the professional sports bubble and become better human beings. \"One of my primary objectives was to facilitate in growing people. That is a wonderful privilege in coaching and leadership. \"I\\'m not in coaching for performance. I\\'m measured on my performance, but I\\'m in leadership and coaching because I want to help people be the best they can be,\" Kirsten explained. \"The players are the ones going out and making the performances and while as a coach I\\'m measured by whether the team do well or not, to me that\\'s almost not as relevant as the influence I can have on individuals in that team. \"I\\'d like to think that in the two years I was with the team I had some impact with some of the players and that\\'s been very important to me.\"\n",

      "ONE HOUR. As little as R50. A hi-tech copier that has watermarking capabilities. And a stamp. This is all that is needed to create a fraudulent document on the streets of Joburg. From a matric certificate to a sick note, a school promotional report or a transfer letter, you could buy anything from R50 to R1 500. While a transfer letter would cost R50, a school report is a mere R100, R150 gets you a sick note and R1 500 can buy you a matric certificate. And while the fraudsters do not advertise, they have a market and word of mouth is their marketing tool. The Sunday Independent tested how easy it is to obtain fraudulent documents. In one week we were able to secure a report, a transfer letter, a matric certificate and a sick note. But the documents failed an authenticity test - authorities rejected them. Our journey starts in Zola, Soweto. My role is that of a teenager\\'s mother. The story is simple: my son has failed Grade 10 and I want him to be promoted to the next grade. I meet a man who claims to have been in the business of selling reports for years. His office is his four-room house, his storage unit an old coal stove. A school report and a transfer note would cost me R150. He takes out an old plastic bag. Inside is a greasy old envelope. In the envelope is his bread and butter - copies of different formats of school reports and transfer letters. The reports and transfer letters are from Trinity High School in Lenasia, south of Joburg. He asks the child\\'s name, date of birth, grade and what he wants to study. He hands over a piece of paper on which I must write the \"perfect\" grades that would leave no doubt at any school that \"my son\" deserves to be enrolled there. He neatly writes the information on the school report. \"My son\" passed Grade 10. He got good marks - 60 percent for accounting and 72 percent in life sciences. The minimum pass mark on the report is 40 percent. Pity he failed mathematics. He got 38 percent. The remarks, supposedly written by the class teacher, are: \"Well done, keep it up!!!\" He takes out a Trinity High School stamp and seals the deal. He says he got the stamp from someone who works at the school. \"Are there not going to be any comebacks? Are you sure my son is going to be admitted at any school with this report,\" I ask. \"Relax, my sister. My stuff works. I can even accompany you to the school,\" he assures me. Later I learn the school has never had such a stamp. Meanwhile, I ask for the transfer letter. He looks in his envelope and realises he has run out of transfer letters. He instructs us to drive to the nearest internet cafe where he says he will type one. He packs up his documents and puts them back in the coal stove. At the internet cafe, the man asks for a piece of paper. He drafts the \"testimonial\" and hands the piece of paper to an assistant to type. \"My son\" and I wait in the car while he goes to a tavern next to the internet cafe. He has had three beers by the time we leave the internet cafe. Back at his \"office\", I notice a spelling error in the transfer letter, but he is drunk and I can\\'t reason with him. I tell him I will be back the next morning for a corrected version. He agrees and tells me I must call him before I arrive. \"I don\\'t like being woken up in the morning,\" he says. The man claims that he makes R2 000 to R3 000 a day from fake reports, especially in January. The next morning when I return, I also ask for a sick note as I was supposedly absent from work the previous day. This was after I learnt that he also makes sick notes. He gives me two days off. I pay him R60. The sick note and stamp are from Tladi Clinic, Soweto, where, the man claims, he has an insider. He tells me that the money he makes from sick notes is his \"petty cash\". His \"serious\" money is from selling reports. But his assuring words that his fake documents are legitimate turn out to be false. The Sunday Independent took the documents to Trinity High School, where principal Calvin Baloyi was shocked at the revelation. \"I just can\\'t believe this,\" said Baloyi. From the moment Baloyi saw the report, he said the school stamp and the letterhead on the report and the transfer letter were not the ones the school used. He said the school reports were not handwritten and each grade received reports on different-coloured paper. Grade 10 reports were, for example, on pink paper. The only things the fraudster got right were the school address and its telephone number. All the school\\'s reports have the Gauteng Department of Education\\'s logo and the school logo. The fake one has neither. The school stamp also has the details of the provincial Education Department. The only things that are handwritten on the original school reports are the signatures of the class teacher and the principal. Baloyi joined the school last year, but was adamant that the school had never had a stamp like that before. An administrator who has worked for the school for years showed The Sunday Independent the school\\'s old stamps. None looked like the one on the fake documents. The transfer letter was also not the same as the one the school uses. When a child comes from another school, explained Baloyi, the new school requires a profile of that child from the old school. If a school were to call looking for the profile of \"my son\" at Trinity High School, the school would not have it. To check this, The Sunday Independent went to a school in Soweto to see if the report would work. The administrator immediately picked up that it was a false report. He agreed with Baloyi that school reports were not handwritten. Moreover, a final-year report had all the pupil\\'s results from the first term to the fourth term. The fake report only had the last term\\'s results. Gauteng Department of Education spokesman Charles Phahlane,said fake reports had no value. He said it was also not easy for pupils to transfer to another school unless they are moving from Grades one or eight. Phahlane said even then, principals, from the new school would phone the previous school to find out the history of a pupil and would be made aware if the pupil failed or has a fake report. To add insult to injury, I was left with egg on my face and R210 less in my pocket. I visited Tladi Clinic to verify if the stamp on the sick note was indeed from the clinic. It turns out the clinic lost its stamp years ago, and it was likely that the one on the fake sick note was the clinic\\'s own stamp. \"How can we get this stamp back? We really need it,\" asked one senior nurse. The clinic now uses a stamp that it is supposed to use when nurses visit schools. The officials said they did not know how the stamp got lost, but said they ruled out any possibility that it was stolen by a colleague. Instead they thought a \"clever patient\" might have stolen it. The stamp was never reported missing, in the hope that it would re-surface. Three nurses, who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, confirmed that the sick note was different from the one used at the clinic. I found, however, that security guards at a local clinic in Soweto were also selling \"legitimate\" sick notes. So the journey continues to the Lillian Ngoyi Clinic. The first security guard tries speaking to a clerk to organise a sick note for my colleague and me. But she comes back saying the clerk is \"scared\". She asks us to try the next gate and speak to the security guards there. One word to the next security guard and we are promised a sick note. He quickly runs to a clerk who has been smoking outside. The security guard later returns to ask for my details and how many days of work I have missed. \"Why did you miss work,\" he asks me. \"I was visiting my boyfriend and I missed work in Pretoria,\" I reply. My colleague and I pretend to be a couple. He later comes out of the clinic while we wait outside, with a message that two days would cost R150. Later, the security guard calls my colleague to join him in the men\\'s toilet. The exchange happens in the toilet. The security guard walks away with R150, while we leave with a brown envelope. It is that simple. The sick note ostensibly has a patient number, doctor\\'s signature and practice number and it indicates that the \"patient\" has been seen by a doctor. When I return to the clinic to notify the authorities about the business taking place there, I see the same security guard keeping watch at the gate. He doesn\\'t recognise me. In the clinic I am told by senior managers that whoever wrote the sick note for me forged a doctor\\'s handwriting. I ask the managers, who did not want to be named, how the person could have known the doctor\\'s practice number. \"These people are clever; they might have seen it somewhere and memorised it.\" But The Sunday Independent confirmed that the practice number on the sick note was not valid. A practice number consists of seven digits and the one on the sick note only had six. A practice number consists of seven digits and the one on the sick note only had six. Lynette Swanepoel from Board of Healthcare Funders,the board responsible for issueing practice numbers to doctors, also confirmed that it was not a valid practice number. Swanepoel said the board gets quarries all the time about fake sick notes. She said the most common one was of receptionist who still doctor\\'s script pads and sell sick notes without the doctor\\'s knowledge. \"It\\'s a huge scam,\" she said. Even though the Gauteng Department of Health said it was not aware of the scam, it had a harsh message for those who have turned clincis into businesses. Spokesperson for the department, Simon Zwane, said the department would investigate the fraud; if the matter is \"proven beyond reasonable doubt\" those involved will face the consequences. \"Any fraudster who uses Gauteng health and in particular Johannesburg Health District resources fraudulently will be dealt with decisively,\" he said. After buying sick notes and reports, I am convinced that money can buy anything. But there was still one more stop. My colleague and I meet the man who is going to sell us a matric certificate in Hillbrow. Our meeting is in a car. I come with a piece of paper with subjects and an ID number that would go on to the certificate. It would take me about an hour to get a matric certificate for \"my brother\". An hour, not 12 years of schooling. The man says sometimes it might take more than an hour to print the certificate as \"police sometimes come and we have to run\". He won\\'t disclose where he prints the certificates. \"Are you sure that my brother is going to get into university with the certificate?\" I ask the man. He tells me he has never done a certificate for someone wanting to go to university, but has produced a lot for people who want to go to colleges and some are working now. \"It\\'s top, top, top... It\\'s the same as the original. It\\'s got the Department of Basic Education and the Umalusi (the council responsible for issuing and verifying matric certificates) logo,\" he says. He says he uses special paper. He can also tamper with certificates, he claims. But if one is caught that the are using a fake certificate, the man says he can unfortunately not assit. \"It\\'s impossible to put it in the system. You can just hope that they don\\'t check the authenticity of the certificate,\" he says. I pay him and he promises to have the certificate ready in an hour. About an hour later, I have a matric certificate in my hand. From afar, it looks legitimate, but it\\'s not the real deal. Manager of certification at Umalusi Anne Janse van Rensburg spotted a number of security features that were flawed in the certificate. She said it was impossible to fake the certificate as the paper was imported and was not available in the country. First, she noted, the fake certificate was lighter compared to the heavier authentic certificate, which weighs 120g. The colours on the fake certificate were wrong and the fonts on it differed from the original one. The font sizes on the fake certificate were bigger too. \"Clearly it is a wrong certificate,\" said Janse van Rensburg. The fake certificate might fool employers or potential employers when photocopied, but it would not get past the gates of a university. According to Janse van Rensburg, universities received matric results electronically after the release of the results. Universities also required students to produce their original matric certificate and to leave a copy. But employers who don\\'t verify the authenticity of their employees\\' matric certificate with Umalusi or other agencies are at risk of falling prey to the fraudsters. Janse van Rensburg said the council often received requests to verify matric certificates from nursing colleges and the bank sector. Many private companies were also making use of the verification process. Even though Gauteng spokesperon for police, Lungelo Dlamini, could not provide numbers , he said police have made several arrests in Hillbrow and Yeoville of people dealing with fake documents. A man had been arrested last year for selling fake sick notes to students at the University of Johannesburg, while another man was also arrested in Pretoria for selling fake Matric certificates for R2000, he said. \"Any person found in possession of the fake documents faces charges of fraud, forgery or dealing with fraudulent documents. Punishment is imposed by the courts,\" said Dlamini. My mission was accomplished. The conclusion? In Joburg, money can buy you anything. But you can also waste it on worthless fakes. - additional reporting Dumisani Dube Bongekile.macupe@inl.co.za\n",

      "Many will agree that if there is one person who polarises opinion within the legal fraternity, it would be Western Cape Judge President John Hlophe. For some, Hlophe\\'s appearance before the Judicial Service Commission committee to consider his alleged attempt to influence two Constitutional Court judges to rule in favour of Jacob Zuma when he faced corruption charges is a culmination of the many controversies he has been involved in. His opponents point to the 2004 case between the late former health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and the pharmaceutical industry when he was accused of having delayed his judgment until the industry took the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal. They will point to allegations that he is said to have referred a sensitive case on Afrikaans language rights to a judge who would \"mess up the case so that it could be taken on appeal\". Then there were issues of Hlophe\\'s son receiving a bursary from a law firm which seemed to have some form of relationship with his dad and the controversial case brought up by US-based Professor Winston Nagan, who claimed Hlophe had defamed him. Attempts have indeed been made to have Hlophe\\'s career brought to a halt. We may remember he was one of the youngest people to be appointed to the Bench post-1994, and was the first full-time academic to be appointed a judge. Coming with a Cambridge doctorate, he was a rising star. So, where did he lose the plot, or did he? And, what does the current enquiry teach us? Most of his critics will point out that Hlophe should have been hauled over the coals for his seemingly errant behaviour, but there might also be those who may argue he should have known better and covered his back. It is almost unavoidable for some of us to suspect that Hlophe has to face these allegations primarily for the 2004 report he wrote to the late Chief Justice Pius Langa in which he claimed racism at the Cape Bar. It will be recalled how prominent members of the Cape Bar Council went into overdrive to try to discredit Hlophe\\'s assertions. The seeming unified force to \"disabuse\" the public of Hlophe\\'s assertions was nonetheless dealt a blow when Dumisa Ntsebeza SC, respected for his long principled struggle for his liberation and impeccable credentials as a jurist, broke ranks and resigned from the Cape Bar, thus giving some credence to the fact that Hlophe\\'s views were not necessarily off the mark. Since 2004, some have judged Hlophe not on his credentials as a brilliant judge, focus has instead been on some of his misjudgments. It has since been as if talking about racism and pointing out alleged racial and racist practices within the legal fraternity is prohibited. We will recall how the same attack and subsequent \"rubbishing\" was mounted against Sipho Seepe after he had made a submission to the Human Rights Commission that there was a need to investigate possible racialised practices and attitudes in the media. Instead of holding a mirror to themselves at the time and asking the self-critical question whether allegations of racial prejudice could be correct, many newsrooms went into a discursive mode which some scholars at the time summarised as \"splitting, dislocating, relativising, trivialising, de-racialising and ultimately reverse racism\". The results were a watered-down report and public debate that failed to address serious problems in newsrooms. Similarly, the manner in which some in the legal fraternity dealt with Hlophe\\'s assertions at the time suggested there was an attempt to dislocate him and trivialise his claims. Thus, in the place of addressing real issues that arise from a history of accumulated white privilege and continued marginalisation of black people (black lawyers in this case) those who express grievances against the system of patronage in the legal fraternity are ridiculed and forced to become defensive. The strategy would not just be to dislocate and trivialise, but to also displace the problem, so that focus can shift from the original grievances (in this case allegations of racism) to something else. Ultimately, the original issues are forgotten, while secondary matters receive sustained attention. Any black person who pursues uncomfortable questions will be subjected to relentless scrutiny of their personal lives, where \"dirt\" will be dug up to silence them, as happened to Paul Ngobeni. And such a person must be punished. That is how ruthless white privilege can be. It is against this background that we must ask whether Hlophe is being brought before the JSC tribunal to serve the interests of a respectable |judiciary or to silence a critical voice. n Tleane is a PhD (Sociology) candidate at UCT.\n",

      "DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko has slammed the official opposition\\'s national communications head, Gavin Davis, in a rant on Facebook. This was after the party was exposed for attempting to intimidate the SA Institute of Race Relations into ending its #SAIRRknowyourANC campaign, which aimed to highlight achievements by the ANC government since 1994. Davis is understood to have asked Mazibuko for help in communicating the party\\'s opposition to the institute\\'s campaign. But Mazibuko did not take kindly to the request. \"People who bully, bait, and are aggressive and offensive in the name of the organisationI represent, must not send me e-mails asking me to go on Twitter and defend their actions,\" she wrote on her Facebook page. \"You are an Emotional Intelligence vacuum. Clean up your own mess. Yes, this is a subtweet. #PoliticalSA\" Mazibuko refused to comment on the post this week, while Davis said it was \"no big deal\". \"People in the DA are free to disagree with each other if they like. Of course it is preferable for people to raise these issues openly and directly in the appropriate forums,\" he said. Davis has taken flack from members of the DA over the incident, and was described by party insiders as divisive. \"He\\'s a f***n prick. He\\'s been incredibly divisive,\" said one leader. Davis, who apparently has the support of DA leader Helen Zille, is also said to have been the reason for the departure from the party of several staff members. \"There\\'s no love between Gavin and almost anyone. He\\'s the most hated executive director, but he\\'s very protected by Helen Zille and everyone knows it,\" the same senior DA leader said. \"Gavin\\'s Helen (Zille\\'s) man.\" But Mazibuko is not the only DA leader to take to Facebook to discuss internal party issues. The Sunday Independent has established that the DA is also investigating one of its leaders in Gauteng for comments he made on Facebook. DA deputy chief whip in the Joburg council and the province\\'s deputy head of its electoral college, Toni Molefe, has been hauled over the coals for comments he made recently on the social networking platform. Molefe is accused of victimising candidates who wanted to go to Parliament and the Gauteng legislature. This was after he wrote to his political ally, DA MP Masizole Mnqasela, that the latter should \"please give me a list of those who did not vote for you at the federal congress, we must not forget their names on Saturday\". Mnqasela contested, and lost to the party\\'s current federal chairman Wilmot James, for the post at the DA\\'s congress last year. Mnqasela is known for his fierce opposition to Mazibuko and Zille. Molefe, a staunch supporter of DA spokesman Mmusi Maimane, posted the comments about two days before the province was to hold a meeting to vote on those it wants to take to the Gauteng legislature and Parliament. Gauteng DA chairman Mike Moriarty confirmed that Molefe was being investigated for this. He said Molefe was asked to recuse himself from the voting process of the electoral college late last month after it came to light that he had made the comments. \"There were candidates who felt that there was an active lobby against them. It is a matter of investigation,\" he said. Moriarty said Molefe had not denied making the comments and that he would be asked to tell his side of the story. \"All of this is done on the presumption of innocence,\" he said. The investigation into Molefe\\'s comments would determine whether or not the party needed to take disciplinary action. Molefe refused to comment. In the report \"DA\\'s Mazibuko lashes colleagues in Facebook rant\", on October 20, 2013, we quoted an anonymous DA leader\\'s negative attitude towards the party\\'s national communications director, Gavin Davis. The comments created an unfair impression that this view was shared by several people in the party and could have been construed as fact. We also failed to give Mr Davis the opportunity to respond to the allegation, as required by the Press Code. We regret the error. Sorry.\n",

The common story goes that they were designed to disfigure the Apatani women, who were otherwise so beautiful that men from the surrounding tribes would raid the valley to kidnap them. Koj Mama, the president of the Arunachal Pradesh Birding Club and director of Brahmaputra Tours, said this was almost certainly an invention. As Tajo, Koj and I drank our rice beer, Buga stood - bent forward nearly 90Âº, his topknot held at his forehead by a long reed - to retrieve a jar of Apatani salt for us to eat with the drink. The fine black powder is made from the evaporated liquids pressed out of a locally grown grass. It\\'s vegetal, briny flavour, infused with the metallic tang of iodine, gives the final kick to a local delicacy known as pike pilla, a simple stew made from smoked pork or mithun skin. Unlike neighbouring tribes that have long practised a nomadic style of shifting cultivation (called jhum), the Apatani have been settled in the valley since their prehistoric migration from the north, giving them the opportunity to develop uniquely sophisticated agricultural and craft techniques. The wet paddies that line the valley floor, for instance, double as fisheries for small freshwater fish, which are either dried and fermented for chutneys or steamed in a hollow stalk of bamboo sealed with leaves and placed in the hot coals of an open fire. This preparation, called sudu, is also commonly used for chicken, liver, eggs and rice. Canny guides like Tajo and Koj - all highly attuned to global trends - will make a point of telling you that the food here is entirely local and organic, an understatement if ever I\\'ve heard one. At the Government Craft Emporium, housed in a creaky colonial bungalow in the village of Salang, craftspeople from the surrounding region receive stipends to come and improve their skills, weaving the traditional geometric shawls and gales (a type of sarong) of the Apatani, Nyishi and Adi tribes. Wander through the compound, and you\\'ll see a woman from the Buddhist Monpa tribe in the state\\'s north-west tying small woollen carpets, a blacksmith crafting tribal machetes and a carpenter fashioning all manner of objects out of bamboo. Some of these craftsmen stay permanently at the centre, while others return to their home villages to pass the skill along. At the mporium store, the final products are sold at shockingly low prices, as little as 450 rupees (about R70) for a handwoven gale. In about four hours, you can walk the road that loops between the villages skirting the edge of the valley floor, and in a day or so you can complete the trail through the dense forest just above. You can linger in the villages themselves, walking beneath the tall ceremonial wooden masts known as babos left from the myoko festival held every March - part of the prevailing sun-and-moon worship tradition - and past old women sifting millet and rice on their front porches. On my last evening, after a brief sunset hike into the forest between Hong and Hari villages, Tajo and I stopped at a house to sample another brew of rice beer and a potent (though barely potable) distilled rice liquor. We ate skewers of beef taken straight from the smoking rack and thrown into the coals. At another house, we ate fish sudu and hot chutneys, and at the end of the night we returned to my own home-stay in a traditional bamboo house back in Hong, where the owner, Tom, made arrangements for my onward journey the next day. After a long day, I fell fast asleep on a bamboo pallet to the conspicuous sound of absolutely nothing. \"There\\'s nothing to see here,\" Tajo Nido (another Tajo) told me a day later. We sat on the porch of his aunt\\'s bamboo hut, built on stilts on a forested hillside looking out over the crests of the surrounding mountains and the sparse wooden and bamboo houses that make up the village of Raga. Home makes us blind. But then, of course, Tajo is right to some extent: there really isn\\'t anything to see in Raga, if we\\'re using \"see\" to mean \"do\". Two hours north of Ziro, Raga sits at a lower elevation, but from its hilltop perch it overlooks the surrounding range of mountains, the kind that hint at higher ones just over the next ragged line embossed upon the sky. The few visitors who pass through here usually do so en route to the town of Daporijo, in the neighbouring district of Upper Subansiri. I myself came here for no particular reason, save for the fact I didn\\'t have quite enough time to go anywhere else and wanted, after five days in Ziro, to see something of Arunachal\\'s diversity. The Nyishi tribe living just outside Ziro bears certain similarities to the Apatani: both tribes, like many in Arunachal\\'s central swathe, are still primarily animist (although the recent arrival of|missionaries from the evangelical state of Mizoram to the south has begun to change that); both tribes subsist almost entirely on agriculture; both tribes prepare food using similar ingredients, though the Nyishi make greater use of tropical plants such as banana flower and lack ingredients such as Apatani salt. Yet the structure of the place, the style of the houses, the character of the people and the landscape, lends Raga a different personality. If Ziro has minimal infrastructure for visitors, then Raga has none. The people who took me around did so out of generosity, a special trait that, throughout the largely unvisited north-east, remains remarkably untainted by the cynicism that can at times make travelling in other parts of India so frustrating. I spent my first evening in Raga at Tajo\\'s home near the market in the town centre, where the next day I sampled another homemade rice brew in a ramshackle house near a mechanic\\'s garage. At the family home, Tajo\\'s stepmother poured us fresh millet wine, sweet and warm and only beginning its fermentation. I used a machete to help Tajo gut the small fish that had come in that day from Ziro, and narrowly avoided losing my left hand. The next evening, Topu Banor, the 19-year-old son of a local folk musician, took me on a short walk from the Circuit House (a simple government accommodation opened only on days when visitors come through, and usually reserved for local dignitaries) to the top of the hill overlooking the town. We walked in the waning afternoon along a muddy road built a couple of years earlier with government funds, Topu told me, but neither completed nor put into use. It\\'s a typical story of negligence that reflects Arunachal\\'s ongoing battle against its almost impossible topography and immense distance from India\\'s centres of power. It also reflects the sense of alienation that remains, also kind of miraculously, tempered by the delirious optimism that has become India\\'s trademark in the 21st century. \"In five years, Raga will be a developed town,\" Topu boasted. Perhaps. Time, too, tends to be flexible out here. As we neared the top of the hill, the clouds and mist so typical in the Land of Dawn-Lit Mountains (the almost too poetic translation of Arunachal Pradesh) had lowered over the faces of the hills, like the cataracts beginning to creep over Buga Bullo\\'s ageless eyes. Drops of water left the tall grasses along the roadside wet as Topu led me towards a small field on the final rise, stubbled with corn stalks. \"You haven\\'t been here, no?\" he asked. \"No,\" I said, as he pushed forward through the damp grass. In the previous days, I had seen places and views that were more perfect, more calming in their pastoral beauty, yet looking out again over a hallucinogenic swirl of hills and clouds and forest, fading through grey towards purple-black night, I couldn\\'t dispute what he said next as he led the way forward with a small, bashful laugh: \"Come. I will show you heaven.\" - The Washington Post l Snyder is a freelance writer based in Mumbai and a contributing editor to Architectural Digest India.

      "AT THE BEGINNING of 1994 fellow non-white South Africans anticipated the day they would vote for the first time in their lives. I anticipated my first day at school. I looked forward to kicking off my learning years at Khuphukani Primary School. The school\\'s name means \"progressing\" in Nguni languages. It is located in a dusty rural area called Tweefontein, deep in the heart of the former KwaNdebele homeland in Mpumalanga. This is where Imbokodo, a quasi-political vigilante group, unleashed terror against residents in 1986 and 1987. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission heard many Imbokodo cases, including the raid in which the group\\'s members fired indiscriminately at Tweefontein\\'s youth. Four youngsters lost their lives in the attack. But the fighting had long stopped at the turn of the 1990s. I looked forward to each day at school once I was enrolled in \"mistress\" Madimabe\\'s Grade 1 class. Yes, I went straight to Grade 1 and didn\\'t start in Grade R. There was no Grade R education during those formative years of the new South Africa. Almost all my classmates and I didn\\'t miss a day of school - that\\'s until the winter gale started blowing. School became unbearable. Most - if not all - windows in our classrooms were broken and the zinc door didn\\'t close properly. This made the classrooms agonisingly cold. As in the entire Tweefontein, there was no electricity at our school. We brought coal and wood from our respective homes to fire imbawula (home-made braziers). At least this kept the classroom warm and Madimabe could continue teaching. Many homes in our community used imbawula. Other homes, like mine, had the advantage of using a coal stove. The winter chill terrorised us in subsequent grades until some time in 1997, when I was in Grade 4. I recall that\\'s when the government\\'s project to fix every broken thing at the school gained momentum. New glass was installed in the classroom windows and doors were fixed. But it would still be a while until the school had proper fencing. Whenever I\\'m home, Khuphukani serves as a reflection of how far we\\'ve come. It\\'s been a proper facility for many years now - with windows, doors and electricity - and it\\'s now fenced. Trees we planted at the school one Friday afternoon in 1997 stand tall, also a reminder of how far we\\'ve come. The entire community now has electricity after a mid-1990s installation project by Eskom. It\\'s amazing how electricity can improve people\\'s lives. Khuphukani and Tweefontein are also perfect examples of the long road we still have to travel towards the realisation of true equality among South Africans. The adjoining piece of land the school is supposed to use as a sports ground is still undeveloped and pebbly, meaning pupils\\' dreams of taking part in sports have been deferred. This stands in contrast to what I see in Johannesburg. Schools here, particularly in the suburbs, have all the sports facilities pupils at my former school can only dream about. The first time I saw people playing hockey was at the Tshwane University of Technology, where I enrolled for journalism studies in 2006. I had seen rugby, swimming and cricket, but also not live. The pupils at my old primary school are growing up without sports facilities. I get a feeling they\\'ll be stuck with their rough and dusty football and netball pitches for many more years to come. Tweefontein itself remains underdeveloped. The only notable development we\\'ve seen in recent years is the tar road that connects us to the notorious Moloto Road. The deadly Putco buses remain the only mode of transport for multitudes who shuttle to Pretoria each day for low-paying jobs. People\\'s dream for trains, which would lower travelling costs and solve the Moloto Road carnage, have been deferred. Despite the Moloto Rail Corridor project having been approved by the national government in 2008, it remains a pipe dream. On the other hand, the money-spinning Gautrain went up in 2010. Democratic South Africa is characterised by socio-economic inequalities, there\\'s no denying that. The government itself is perpetuating the disparities and creating new ones. This is how I experience the country 20 years down the line. I see the country through the eyes of Thabo Mbeki when he talks about South Africa being \"a country of two nations\". There\\'s the rags Alexandra-type South Africa and there\\'s the Sandton-riches South Africa - communities so close yet so far. The time has come for us to take another long walk to freedom. Only selfless leaders are needed at the forefront. bongani.nkosi@inl.co.za\n",

      "Are YOU \"Eugreen\"? That was the question posed to Nedbank two weeks ago by climate change activists at 350Africa.org who called on the bank to disclose the true extent of its fossil-fuel investments. You may have seen the television adverts starring Eugene, a savvy young man being up-sold financial products by an oddly patriarchal banker. An alternative version of the adverts is doing the rounds on Facebook and YouTube. In it Eugene becomes Eugreen, covered head to foot in green paint and initially oblivious to the fact that he is greenwashed and complicit in Nedbank\\'s claim to be South Africa\\'s \"only real green bank\". After coughing through scenes in which coal power stations pollute the air, Eugreen has a moment of clarity, subverts the narrative and challenges the Nedbank guy to come clean about how the bank can claim to be green and yet has financed about R1 billion of coal projects. The blunt point is that there\\'s a serious hypocrisy at play here. Nedbank, Standard Bank and Absa collectively sunk R10 billion of direct financing into coal projects between 2005 and 2013, which in turn contributed to combined annual profits of over R32bn in the 2013 financial year. The face of the South African banking industry may be greenwashed but its heart is as dark as coal. These publicly available figures are just the tip of the iceberg because many banks are happy to highlight their investments in renewable energy but hide the full extent of their financing of fossil-fuel projects. Why? Because there is a great deal of money to be made and for the fossil-fuel industry it\\'s a good thing if South Africa falls deeper into its current addiction to coal. Eighty percent of our energy comes from a dirty 19th-century fuel source that uses and pollutes huge amounts of scarce water and ruins air quality. For more than 60 years the true cost of coal has ultimately been paid for with their health by the people of Witbank, Springs, the Vaal and many other communities. Against this backdrop the South African government is considering backing future coal power stations and hundreds of new coal mining licences that are also under consideration. In places like the pristine Waterberg biosphere, and at Mtunzini and the Imfolozi National Park, both in KwaZulu-Natal, new mines pose a twin threat to the well-being of people and to natural heritage. Then there is climate change, the ultimate threat to our future. We remain the continent\\'s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases that are the principle driver of the changing global climate. It is humans who are ultimately the cause and we are really beginning to push our luck. The safe liveable limit for our planet is 350 parts per million of CO2 in the Earth\\'s atmosphere, which would hold average global temperature rises to 20C. In June this year that figure broke through 400 parts per million. What this means is that 80 percent of known global fossil-fuel reserves must stay in the ground if we are to have any chance of holding to a 20C rise. Even that would see some parts of sub-Saharan Africa experience devastating temperature increases of 40C or even higher. Rising temperatures already mean we are experiencing more extreme weather such as drought and flooding as well as ominously rising sea levels. The resulting shocks to food prices and water shortages hit the most vulnerable hardest but will ultimately affect us all. In South Africa, the government, labour and civil society broadly agree on one key principle to tackle climate change: we must undertake a just transition away from fossil fuels to a clean-energy future powered in large part by renewable energy, including the large-scale realisation of our huge solar and wind potential. The question is \"how and how fast?\" A clean energy future powering a low-carbon development path is possible. What is needed is a step change in ambition and political will to scale up the renewable energy revolution. Back the renewable energy sector and the benefits will multiply. Technology solutions will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of solar PV and wind-turbine units. Advances in electricity storage will help unlock the biggest win to extend access to electricity potentially via community-owned local generation facilities that move us away from massive central production and costly grid infrastructure. With scale will follow job creation in both installation and maintenance. Nuclear is not an option. A R1 trillion deal will bankrupt the country. The environmental risks are too high and the 10 to 16-year build time for proposed facilities would mean breaking the upper limit of our agreed CO2 targets as emissions grow in the meantime. Clearly this kind of just transition will not happen overnight but, with the red lights flashing, people are no longer prepared to just sit and wait for governments and businesses to act. Global leaders have failed us time and again by protecting the interests of the fossil-fuel industry and putting short-term economic and political goals ahead of our collective long-term survival. Across the world people are joining the fight for climate justice by using their collective power as bank account-holders, students and academics, religious leaders and members of faith-based communities to force public institutions to get their money out of coal, oil and gas. Divestment, employed by the anti-apartheid movement to hit companies where it hurt most, is again the inspiration. As the Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, puts it: \"People of conscience need to break their ties with the corporations financing the injustices of global climate change.\" The fossil-fuel divestment movement is growing fast with the World Council of Churches the latest of 160 public institutions globally to commit to divesting. Eugreen marks the launch of the Fossil Free Africa divestment campaign which begins by calling on Nedbank to fully disclose its fossil-fuel investments, to develop a truer risk profile of fossil-fuel investments that will account for the real human effects of fossil fuels and ultimately to commit to stopping financing future mining, refineries and power station projects in South Africa and across Africa. As global leaders returned once more to the annual climate negotiations at COP 20 in Lima last week, the message from the climate movement was clear. We need action now, not words, and we are going to help you make the right decisions by holding you and the businesses responsible for massive greenhouse gas emissions accountable to the realities of climate science. Such is the scale of the global crisis we face that we have reached the point where every emitting country must commit to and honour emissions cuts, albeit based on a fair and equitable approach that reflects differing developmental status. South Africa must make its own contribution to cutting emissions as part of the global effort. We have a critical role to play in negotiating together with the Africa group of countries and the wider developing world, particularly as developed countries will seek once again to move the goalposts and avoid emissions targets. Without fixed emissions targets for each country and timeframes by which they must be met, it will be impossible to calculate whether the sum of all contributions adds up to the cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that science says are vital if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change. The options are for binding national targets and timeframes potentially enforced by international and local law or for targets and timeframes voluntarily set without a strong system of rules and enforcement. The latter option is favoured by the US and others and it is why the recent announcement by the US and China of improved emissions targets was greeted with scepticism. As a symbolic gesture by the two largest emitting countries, this may well generate momentum at COP 20. However, based on the figures alone, the cuts are not enough and the pledges remain unbinding for the moment. For Beijing to commit for the first time to any kind of emissions cap marked a response to growing public pressure within that country to tackle an urban air quality crisis. This poor air quality is matched in South Africa in areas including the Vaal, where environmental justice organisations have won a 10-year legal battle with ArcelorMittal to force the release of its environmental management plan. This, of course, is the real point. Unless we keep up relentless pressure on leaders and the fossil-fuel industry, there will continue to be politically expedient decisions, backsliding, closed-door deal-making and the protection of vested fossil-fuel interests. It is the people who have done the least to contribute to climate change who will suffer the most. It needs all of us to join the fight for climate justice and hold leaders and business accountable for the realities of climate science. After all, this will affect every one of us. It might seem a long way off but we can have a fossil-free South Africa and Africa in which we put people first, not profits. - 350Africa.org n Adam is 350Africa and Arab world regional team leader and has campaigned for environmental justice with Groundwork, Earthlife and Greenpeace Africa and gained an M Phil in Environmental Management from UCT.

      "The white, sandy soil stretched into the distance like a beach on the cover of a travel magazine. A few clouds floated past the warm sun. It was a beautiful day for exploring the No 6 slimes dam at the abandoned Blyvooruitzicht gold mine. But then the wind began to turn, kicking up fine dust. Full of uranium and other heavy metals, the grit forced its way into coughing lungs and watering eyes. Not far down the road, in Blyvoor village, the dust advanced towards pupils gathered in a school\\'s grounds. Nearby, a group of unemployed former miners opened a meeting, oblivious to the cloud of toxins as they discussed imminent water and electricity shut-offs. A few streets over on the abandoned mine itself, illegal miners, or zama zamas, from Lesotho ignored the pollution, focusing on scraping a living out of the dirt. Since 1886, when George Harrison discovered gold in the Witwatersrand, mining has been the force behind Joburg\\'s growth from the world\\'s largest boomtown into |a metropolitan area of more than 10 million people. Now citizens of eGoli - the Place of Gold - have to coexist with mines and waste facilities in the world\\'s largest gold and uranium basin while adapting to a rapidly shrinking industry. \"Mining is part of South Africa\\'s psychology. People say it\\'s in our DNA, but mining is - by definition - unsustainable,\" said Mariette Liefferink, chief executive officer of the Federation for a Sustainable Development and a vocal activist in the world of gold mines. The abandoned Blyvooruitzicht mine lies a few kilometres south of Carletonville. The mine opened in 1937, but labour disputes, disappearing reserves and a sluggish market shuttered it. First came business rescue in 2011, then an attempted sale by the majority shareholder DRDGOLD in 2012 and finally liquidation while under the guidance of the potential buyer, Village Main Reef, in 2013. Neither company claims to own the mine or acknowledges liability. The Department of Mineral Resources has yet to step in to ease the situation. \"Some of our people are struggling to get employment. The other ones are being hit by age because most of the mining companies don\\'t employ you if you\\'re over 45 years of age,\" said a member of the Blyvoor community committee, who asked not to be named because zama zamas and others benefiting from Blyvooruitzicht\\'s closure have threatened him for speaking out. Retrenched from the mine\\'s human resources department when the mine was liquidated, he is waiting for R250 000 for unpaid service. \"There are so many people in my position - 1 700 people were affected by the liquidation. They never got anything,\" he said. Many of them survive on food donations from the Dutch Reformed Church: a free meal for schoolchildren, R2 for adults. \"As the gold becomes less and less, it becomes less and less economically viable for major corporations and a big, capital-intensive, expensive operation to extract that gold,\" said David van Wyk, of the Bench Marks Foundation. \"A lot of mines have scaled down, a lot have closed down, a lot have been abandoned, and a lot of workers have been retrenched.\" In a 2007 revised environmental management programme, the Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining Company Limited wrote: \"Gold mining has played an important role in the development of the town\\'s economy and as a result the industries in the area are, with only a few exceptions, associated with mining activities.\" During the short period Village worked the mine, it halved the workforce. When the mine was liquidated, the remaining workforce was disbanded. There were few non-mining jobs in Blyvoor, and most residents did not have the means to move to|other areas. Job security was not the residents\\' only concern. Living close to a gold mine directly affected health and environmental well-being. On numerous occasions, pipes and slimes dams full of toxic and radioactive material burst or were washed away, sending mine waste into parts of Carletonville. An August 2005 report to the National Nuclear Regulator noted: \"The previous acting (radiation protection officer) did not submit (regulator) for the previous six months. \"The (acting officer) did not conduct personal dose measurements for the past 12 months.\" DRDGOLD\\'s chief executive, NiÃ«l Pretorius, said it would be difficult to convince the company to put money back into the mine or the community. Perhaps the state of the mine was the fault of the major unions, the liquidator or the parties who bought the stripped assets from the liquidator, he said. \"I\\'m going to find it very, very hard, very, very difficult, to get a mandate from my board and my shareholders, if I were seeking a mandate to this effect, to go and put 50, 100, 150 million rand into this mine,\" he said. Marius Saaiman, chief executive officer of Village, said although the company ran the mine for a time it had not owned Blyvooruitzicht, nor had it controlled the trust fund intended for environmental rehabilitation. An estimated 11 000 people live in several villages and informal settlements on and around Blyvooruitzicht, not far from the dust-generating No 6 slimes dam. Children living in one of the informal settlements swim in water that pools on the footprint of another slimes dam. When the mine was operating at high capacity in the early 2000s, it piled 200 000 tons of waste a month on to its tailings dumps. The products of more than a century of intense mining, 270 similarly massive tailings piles, mine dumps and slimes dams are scattered in and around Joburg. The National Nuclear Regulator classifies these tailings dams as \"nuclear installations\". \"This is a slow onset disaster,\" Liefferink said. A 2011 study found an estimated 1.6 million people - a number surely growing with the influx of migrants - living in Gauteng\\'s informal settlements, many on or near toxic and radioactive mine residue areas. These areas are often referred to as \"badlands\" because they are unsuitable for most uses. They cover 321kmÂ². \"No one else would want that land,\" Van Wyk said. \"The land is radioactive. The land is full of poison. The land is very dangerous to live on, and so the poorest of the poor in South Africa find themselves on that land.\" Van Wyk\\'s work as an activist and researcher in the field of corporate social responsibility takes him to areas affected by mining activities and legacies. One such place is Riverlea, a largely coloured, low-income housing community bordered on the north and south by mine dumps. \"If you look at a community like Riverlea, it\\'s surrounded by mines. If you look at a community like Soweto, it\\'s surrounded by mines. But none of the people who lived there actually worked in the mines because mines were supplied by migrant labour,\" Van Wyk said. Residents say the partially remediated tailings piles surrounding them are the cause of respiratory issues, skin and eye irritation and other ailments. However, there is a lack of epidemiological studies into the effect of mining on health in communities, so litigation is nearly impossible. The use of paraffin, coal fires and asbestos paint confuses the picture with regard to the cause of many sicknesses in such areas. Charles van der Merwe, a Riverlea resident and member of the Mining and Environmental Justice Community Network of South Africa, has gone door to door with questionnaires to compile a health study. He grew up breathing in the dust from these dumps and said it became a way of life. \"You can put tape on the doors. The dust will still come in. You don\\'t know where, but it will still come in,\" he said. \"Here in Riverlea, we\\'re so used to it. It\\'s our dusty time.\" DRDGOLD blames the town\\'s seemingly high rates of respiratory issues on the use of coal stoves, although few houses continue to use them. The company bought 500 gas stoves two years ago to distribute to the community to remove the need for open-fire stoves, but residents say the gas refills are too expensive for them. \"I was rather disappointed that it was received with so little enthusiasm, but they\\'re still there and, you know, we\\'re trying to engage,\" Pretorius said. Remining of the sand dump north of the community was expected to finish in a year, and revegetating of the dumps in the south was progressing rapidly, Pretorius said. Central Rand Gold Limited also owns mines in the area. One of its operations has been abandoned - except for the zama zamas working there - for some time. According to Van Wyk and residents, Central Rand Gold, a junior mining company, offered the community a paltry sum every month if residents would rehabilitate the mine for it. The amount said to have been offered would barely have covered a few days\\' work and there was no closure plan. Multiple attempts were made to contact Central Rand Gold, without success. \"This is the legacy of mining,\" Liefferink said. \"It looks glamorous. It glitters when you see it on the catwalks. It\\'s a wonderful metal. But it has a price, and the price we pay, especially the poor communities. \"Gold is dirty.\" n Olalde is a young American journalist who cut his teeth at The Star as an intern from the Medill School of Journalism at Chicago\\'s Northwestern University. This year he returned to South Africa, sponsored by the Fund for Investigative Journalism and hosted by Wits University\\'s Centre for Sustainability in Mining and Industry, to investigate the phenomenon of illegal miners or zama zamas for The Sunday Independent. This is what he found.

      "THE last place you should expect to find Nompumelelo Mqweba is in a Sandton cafÃ©. She isn\\'t eating anything though, just having coffee and using the free wi-fi. The menu would hardly suit her, because Mqweba is an advocate of African cuisine like pap, ujeqe and imbuya, not the pizzas, pastas and burgers that proliferate in South Africa. Mqweba is aiming to build national pride in our home-grown food, but pinning down exactly how she\\'s going to do that is difficult, because she\\'s got so much on her plate. There\\'s her effort to persuade farmers to reinstate traditional crops and farming methods; a push to encourage more women to enrol in cookery schools and work up to be head chefs; cookery demonstrations; a food blog and a column in The Mercury; and a sponsor to find for her annual food fair. Her newest project will let us taste some of her creations as she teams up with chef Kosta Kosmas to feature some African dishes at his soon-to-open Metro Restaurant in Bryanston. Mqweba grew up surrounded by food, because her grandmother ran a cafeteria in Howick and had an orchard growing all sorts of fruit that she used in her dishes. \"My first burn was on her coal stove,\" Mqweba remembers. \"She was the first person who taught me how to make ujeqe, the steamed Zulu bread.\" Later, the family lived in Durban and her father, a ship\\'s cook, came home bearing food from \"anywhere and everywhere\", she says. \"But with such good cooks at home I was scared to cook because everyone used to critique - \\'you could have put more salt there or it needs more chilli\\',\" she remembers. Later she cooked for friends and family, but worked in textiles and then in recruitment. \"I was doing well but I wasn\\'t happy and I decided I wanted to take my cooking seriously so I resigned, took my package and went to a cookery school.\" The school ran a restaurant and she also worked at another restaurant in her spare time to gain more experience. Once she qualified she drove to the five-star Zimbali Lodge and got a job that hadn\\'t actually existed. She drove in, walked straight to the kitchen and got herself introduced to the executive chef, she says. \"I decided it was where I wanted to work because I wanted the best.\" Even then she realised that South Africa does little to promote its traditional foods. \"At cookery school we didn\\'t cover African cuisine, we didn\\'t cover anything I grew up eating. \"Ethiopian and Senegalese and north African food is called cuisine, but here at the bottom of Africa it\\'s something you might find stuck in a corner. Why are we not taught African methods of cooking using African crops and learning the culture behind it? There needs to be a mind-shift.\" Our historical records haven\\'t been well preserved, and the traditional passing of farming and cooking knowledge from one generation to the next was destroyed by the forced movement of people during apartheid, she says. Farming methods have become commercial and dictated by Western tastes, so indigenous crops that could have survived the recent droughts have been lost and farmers took a battering as a result, she believes. \"People tell me they can\\'t find the food they see me cooking on my blog, and it\\'s because the farmers grow what the market wants,\" she says. \"The old crops are still there, but grown just for themselves. I\\'m working with farmers and I cook the foods and present them in a way that\\'s suitable for restaurants.\" Mqweba has been inspired by attending the Ballymaloe Organic Farm and Cookery School in Ireland, where Darina Allen\\'s efforts are turning Ireland\\'s former food inferiority complex into a pride in its national dishes. Done properly, South Africa could market itself as a culinary tourism destination, Mqweba believes, not just as a safari spot with fabulous wines. \"We are busy cooking everyone\\'s food except for whatever is originally from this country, and the moment we do that we have the potential for culinary tourism. \"We\\'re always talking about couscous but we have our own version in phuthu (maize meal). Why can\\'t we serve phuthu and kale with peanuts in a restaurant?\" Her company, Africa Meets Europe, is working with the Central Johannesburg College to mentor its cookery students by involving them in its cooking demonstrations, and trying to find them internships. She wants to see more women rise through the industry, but says kitchens are fairly hostile places that tend to be chauvinistic and racist. \"Women are second-class citizens and black women are third-class,\" she says. \"People don\\'t like to hear about women going into leadership positions - it irritates the hell out of them.\" Not enough people in South Africa are listening to her campaign, but foreigners certainly are. Mqweba was invited to cook at a Taste of Chicago festival because Durban is a sister city to Chicago. \"I made pap with tomato relish and ostrich meat, and in the end our stand had the longest queue of people wanting to try it,\" she says. She also cooked at the South Africa Season in Paris in 2013, presenting South African cuisine at a series of lunches and dinners. Now she\\'s about to train the chefs in the Metro Restaurant so they can produce a few of her dishes when it opens. The chefs probably eat these dishes already at home, she says, but she\\'ll show them the flourishes that elevate them to restaurant standard in taste and presentation. She\\'s had offers to open restaurants in partnership with other chefs, but turns down those opportunities so she can try to feed minds rather than stomachs. \"If I was to run a restaurant I wouldn\\'t have time to do all this. I\\'d be in the kitchen every night cooking.\" Baobab cheesecake, anyone? l See more atwww.africameetseurope.co.za\n",

      "SO MANY potatoes, so little time is a mantra worth repeating when you visit Newtown\\'s The Potato Shed. Opened in late 2015, The Potato Shed is housed in the historic building (from 1911) that was once Joburg\\'s potato shed, serving the city\\'s vegetable market in Newtown. Trivia buffs: should seek out the railway tracks running alongside the restaurant\\'s outdoor deck to impress your friends. This is a slick urban sister restaurant to the Life CafÃ© brand usually found in malls, designed and produced by Maira Koutsoudakis and team who are known for innovative leisure-inspired architecture and interior designs. It\\'s a great location. Next door is the fabulous local design emporium Work Shop New Town; across the piazza Newtown Junction Mall (with plenty of secure covered parking) and City Lodge Newtown Hotel (think city weekend getaway), a short walk along the paved avenue is The Market Theatre. But back to the potato. As the centrepiece of this eatery\\'s menu the spud shines. From whirly triple- fried chips and wood-oven roasted potatoes to slashed and stuffed spuds, crispy potato skins, string fries, mashed potatoes and even an aloo pakora battered mustard mash bread, it\\'s veritable potato porn. And enough to make Banting diet advocate Dr Tim Noakes apply for a court interdict. The menu here shows great attention to detail and a real desire to tantalise the taste buds. There\\'s plenty of the expected served in delightfully unexpected ways, like the bunny chow filled with pulled pork or Jozi beef, some pickled fish or a selection of vegetable pickles from the restaurant\\'s \"Curing Room\". Meat dishes from the fire pit are designed for large appetites and include a 1kg fire-pit poker of lamb on the coals with oregano, lemon and garlic and a 1kg hot chicken poker spiced in Mozambican \"pele pele\" style. Portions are large enough to satisfy a flock of hungry miners and it is advisable to eat here with people who enjoy sharing their food. Perhaps send a questionnaire to friends before you book. In keeping with The Potato Shed\\'s steam-punk-BBQ- smokehouse-bootlegger-hideaway inspired interior is a celebration of some industrial age cooking methods. We didn\\'t get to try dessert, but they looked suitably decadent, especially the Fire on Ice blow-torched meringue chocolate ice cream with black cherries, confit oranges and chocolate cake.There\\'s a fine drinks selection, a wraparound bar and a party atmosphere on the outside deck on weekends. Finally, Newtown has a good pre-theatre dinner attraction. â— This review appears in the city guide, Johannesburg In Your Pocket. Seewww.johannesburg.inyourpocket.com\n",

      "Come to this homely Afrikaans \"plaaskombuis\" or \"farm kitchen\" in Northcliff for bulging plates of traditional tuisgebakte (homemade) bobotie, kaas jaffel, vetkoek, skilpadjies and maalvleis. If you don\\'t know what these things are, ask for an English menu and prepare your stomach for a mammoth meal. Traditional Afrikaans cuisine, or Boerekos, is rich and hearty and has never been known for small portions. The Bergbron Plaaskombuis pays homage to the South African flavours of chef and owner Johan Smith\\'s childhood, particularly the traditional boerekos that his grandmother used to cook. It\\'s the kind of unpretentious and good value comfort food you\\'d more typically find far from a big city like Joburg. The cafÃ© is set out just as you might find at a farm kitchen in many small South African towns. A long, shady stoep or veranda, lined by window boxes filled with herbs, occupies the entire side of a single-storey building which overlooks a small garden nursery. There\\'s a padstal or farm shop selling local home-made jams and preserves, and a soaring steel wind pump stands guard at the entrance. Everything on the menu is home-made on the day according to time-honoured recipes handed down through Johan\\'s family. There\\'s Tannie (Auntie) Una\\'s deeply flavoursome lamb stew, Tannie Bessie\\'s filling chicken pie and Oupa (Grandpa) Andries\\'s sausages spiced with cayenne pepper. Even the bread is freshly baked on site each morning and if you arrive at the right time you\\'ll be treated to the sight of trays of fluffy fresh scones emerging from the old-fashioned coal-fired oven which sits on the veranda. Service is warm and friendly and guests are greeted with a small glass of refreshing gemmer bier (ginger beer) on arrival. So popular is this home-made ginger beer that Bergbron reportedly sells up to 75 litres of the stuff on a weekend day. There\\'s also moerkoffie on the stove on weekends. Made by simmering coarsely ground coffee for several hours, the coffee gets stronger as the day goes on until it reaches pure rocket fuel strength. Breakfast is served all day and options include the sonop jaffel (sunrise toastie) with fried egg, bacon and cheese, putu pap (crumbly maize porridge) with maalvleis (minced meat) or a classic cooked breakfast with all the works, served in rustic enamel plates. This is great way to start another busy day in the big city. l This review appears in the city guide, Johannesburg In Your Pocket, available in print, online and as a digital app. Seewww.johannesburg.inyourpocket.com.\n",

      "SITUATED on the top floor of Rosebank\\'s newly opened Trumpet building, Marble restaurant has distinct polish and finesse. It was a warm Monday evening and, with its being my friend\\'s birthday the following day, I was delighted to find that, unlike many restaurants, acclaimed chef David Higgs\\'s newly established Marble was open. As a starter, we shared a plate of spicy chicken wings. Basted in a thick and particularly spicy sauce, they were a bit too peppery for my friend, but I thought they were just right. Blackened octopus and overnight coal-roasted soup are among the other intriguing starter options. On the waiter\\'s advice, I ordered the pork neck and my friend a well-done sirloin steak. My pork neck came with a lovely grilled pineapple, jalapeÃ±o syrup, remoulade and pork crackling. I also ordered fries as a side. The sirloin came with a spinach and mushroom salad, roasted cauliflower, and fries. My friend found himself regretting ordering his steak well done as it was a bit tough to chew and bland on the taste buds. My pork neck on the other hand was tender and delicate, the pineapple and jalapeÃ±o syrup giving it a palatable sweetness. Other mains include rib-eye steak, prawns, and lamb cutlets. Marble embraces South Africa\\'s unique braai heritage by employing a wood-fired grill, with the chefs preparing food on an open fire in the exposed kitchen. The fire burns cleanly, with barely a puff of smoke. Despite its selection of salads, Marble is distinctly meat-focused. After the filling portions of our mains, we shared an ice-cream sandwich - almond meringue with halva ice cream. It wasn\\'t mind-blowing, but it served as a delicate and sweet taster. Other dessert options include a passion fruit parfait and a strawberry concoction with burnt strawberries, pistachio creme, ash meringue, and a Greek dessert of nut-and-honey pastry rolls, kataifi. With its wood and marble decor, Marble is a smooth blend of sophisticated and down-to-earth dining. It will soon be opening a boutique butchery offering some of the cuts available in the restaurant. After dinner, my friend and I retreated to the bar area to cap off our evening with drinks. Situated in its own sleek and elegant corner, this contemporary bar has a completely different feel from the restaurant. A huge glass-encased wine rack with a few dozen wine and champagne bottles stands between the main area of the restaurant and the bar. The bar has its own menu, with a unique selection of bites and a wide variety of cocktails. A mixologist is on hand to mix any drink of your liking from the wide range of mixers available - we enjoyed trying out a few drinks, including the fiery hand grenade shooter. The neatly decorated terrace looks over Joburg\\'s starry skyline, providing a glittering view and is an ideal place to hang out. When I come again, this is where you\\'ll find me.\n",

      "A FUSION of art and architecture is unfolding on Rosebank\\'s Keyes Avenue. This street development, known as Keyes Art Mile, looks to reinvigorate and reimagine the typically dense and overwhelming shopping mall experience. The newly opened Trumpet building is the first step in the development. With its emphasis on collaborative and communal lifestyles coming together, this art, design and fashion hub features cafÃ©s, galleries and other artisanal spaces. Several stores, including Anatomy Design, are at street level. During a media walk-through of the Trumpet building, Anatomy co-owner Andrea Kleinloog spoke of the inspiration behind the store: \"At the beginning of this year we went through a big process of unpacking and repacking what Anatomy Design is. \"For a long time we\\'d been operating under the Anatomy umbrella as retail and interior, then we realised both needed a lot more consideration.\" Instead of \"fighting two huge storms with one umbrella\", they decided to split the interior design from the retail wing. \"We have two qualified interior designers who\\'ll be running the shop and they can meet people and help them in choosing furniture and the like for their house or offices.\" Next door to Anatomy is BGR, a burger joint that looks to bring the authentic taste of the traditional American burger to South Africa. Jed Goldstein and Josh Cherry, the two Americans who own and run BGR, describe it as a fast casual restaurant - a term that describes a type of restaurant without the sit-down table-service experience, yet still offering a higher quality of food than fast-food outlets. \"This is our attempt to bring the burgers we grew up with in our households, but just couldn\\'t find here in South Africa.\" Frustrated by the hustle and bustle of South African malls, the two found Trumpet, with its easygoing appeal, the ideal place to open their first restaurant. They had been using a small space at the Caltex garage around the corner. Also on the street level is Shelflife, which sells premium sneakers, streetwear and a host of collectable products. The store brings a bit of youth culture to Trumpet. With 60 percent of its orders coming from Joburg, it was just a matter of time before Shelflife opened a store here. Shelflife started out as a graffiti supply store in Cape Town, but the owners soon discovered they couldn\\'t make enough money selling spray paint alone. In the building\\'s atrium are a slew of galleries and other creative spaces. Some are not quite ready to open yet. A collaborative space between WhatIfTheWorld, a gallery focusing on work by contemporary artists from Africa, and popular design gallery Southern Guild, which offers functional pieces such as furniture, ceramics and lighting, is one of the most visually appealing spaces on this floor. There is a trend for art and design collaborations, says gallery co-director Londi Modiko. \"We decided to open up a space in Joburg to encourage and share this trend. The vision of this space is to advance the careers of designers and artists as well as to encourage collaboration. \"Because Joburg is a cultural hub as well as a business hub, it just made sense to have this space here, particularly in this Rosebank precinct.\" On display in the gallery are beautiful art pieces by some of the best African designers and artists. The top floor of the building is reserved for Marble, Joburg\\'s first live-fire restaurant. This exceptionally designed contemporary restaurant, headed by chef David Higgs and with a terrace overlooking the city, offers patrons the chance to see meat, fish, poultry, vegetables and bread being cooked on coals. Our walk-through concluded at Mesh Club, a members\\' club where entrepreneurs may meet, work, socialise and connect. The first of its kind, the Mesh Club is equipped with boardrooms, a cinema, exhibition spaces, and a bar area with a mixologist on hand. Its founder, Jonathon Meyer, who found inspiration for this club while travelling, explained what it was that made the Mesh Club such a unique space for entrepreneurs to meet and connect. \"From our community manager, who is able to facilitate one-on-one coffee meetings with other members, to the meeting rooms, the catwalk table and the cinema, Mesh is equipped to provide many platforms for members to connect with other like-minded people. \"With the Keyes Art Mile amalgamating lifestyle, art and design, it provides the perfect platform for the Mesh Club to bring together young creatives and established entrepreneurs.\" Other stores at Trumpet Retro-chic African cafÃ© Milk Bar; designer boutique stores Missibaba and Okapi; furniture and design store Cassina; boutique interior architecture firm Studioâ€‰A; and Flos, which produces and designs high-quality lamps.

      "THE surge in home-grown content on the big and small screens attests to the proliferation of talent in the industry. And Wandile Molebatsi is among the celebrated contributors to storytelling in South Africa. An actor, as well as executive producer with Coal Stove Pictures, his soapie credits in M-Net\\'s The Wild and e.tv\\'s Rhythm City made him a household name. Last weekend, he attended the Saftas as Thula\\'s Vine, a poignant drama delving into the contentious issue of land reclaim, was nominated for the Best Achievement in Directing -TV Drama- but lost to iNumber Number. Still, the fact that it registered on the radar of the judging panel was good enough for Molebatsi. He says: \"Wow. It was surreal. Thula\\'s Vine was the first 13-part drama series that we have ever produced as Coal Stove Pictures and to get a nomination was amazing. It was also emotional as it was based on the battles that clan Bakubung Ba Ratheo have gone through to get the land back. There are still massive farms that were taken and are currently under claim. It\\'s going to be a long process.\" Given the pertinence of the subject matter, his passion in discussing it knows no bounds. Then again, it is this gusto that has seen him achieve great success in his two decades in the industry. He laughs: \"Can you believe it? Twenty years and it feels like I started learning yesterday. I started as a child actor in films like Cry, the Beloved Country, Born Free and Shuba Lodge. So the bug had bitten very early on when I was still at home messing around with my three brothers and a horde of crazy cousins who would invade my mother\\'s living room and kitchen over the holidays.\" Reflecting on being drawn to the performing arts, he says, \"I was a toddler in the USA. My parents had taken us to Disneyland and I was crazy about Winnie The Pooh. I remember seeing him during a parade and I wrestled free from my mother\\'s grip and started dancing with characters.\" Molebatsi continues: \"My first proper set experience was with James Earl Jones on the set of Cry, The Beloved Country. He looked like a giant at the time and I was playing his young son. I was in awe of how he and director Darrell Roodt seemed to speak in their own language.\" When he was at Wits, Coal Stove Pictures was formed. It\\'s been a decade since, and his team of creatives have been working hard towards changing the face of TV and film. That youthful optimism led to the conception of Africa\\'s first dance movie, Hear Me Move. The executive producer explains, \"Scottness Smith (business partner) and I have always believed that our \\'African cool\\' can compete with the best \\'cool\\' in the world. And we figured the best place to start would be with our dance music.\" Wearing more than one hat, Molebatsi explains how he divides his passion. \"The two disciplines are vastly different. An acting pro is that you get to create a life and a world with the director. You become the emotional touch point for the audience, where they can fall in love, feel hurt or be disappointed by the character. But there are drawbacks. You are not in control of your destiny. \"On the producing side, as a father and husband, you can map out a level of financial stability that you owe to your family. You can also find the stories and work on putting the finance and talent packages together. But, it\\'s a business. Things are bound to get tough and you need to have the financial, emotional and creative support of your entire team. \"There is also so much to learn and, in this digital age, you need to be on the pulse of the trends. As a young black producer, it takes time to get people to trust you. Another reason why the Safta nomination was so crucial. We are building a track record as trustworthy producers who offer value with our content to our broadcast investors.\" In an industry that could break you as easily as it made you, maintaining humility and reputation is paramount. Molebatsai says he is always mindful of never veering far from those values. Lastly, he hints at what his production company has in the kitty. \"Coal Stove Pictures is working on iKani, SABC\\'s first isiNdebele drama series. We are super excited about this project and we have been working on it for two years. We start production at the end of April. The NFVF has also awarded us the Feature Film Slate. So we are working on delivering nine feature film scripts. \"We are sealing up the deal for the Hear Me Move sequel with a distributor. Scottness Smith has set up Coal Stove Australia and he has identified three great scripts that we are hoping to produce next year. South Africa and Australia have a co-production treaty that has been in effect since 2010.\"\n",

      "This time it is the Gautrain. Last time – March 2021 – it was eNCA reporter Lindsay Dentlinger, who claimed to not be racist after we had witnessed her act in a patently racist manner when she insisted that black politicians don their masks while she was fine with white politicians speaking to her without their masks donned. But, I digress. Back to our racist pics in our beloved elite train, the Gautrain. The type of apparently inadvertent racism, bluntly displayed on the Gautrain, which has made life easier for the middle class, much as it has created thousands of jobs, to its credit. The operators, management, marketing and advertising teams of the high-speed train should be called out on the undesirable racism expressed – whether inadvertently, by design or omission – in their vaccination adverts, now replaced by other ads – that exhibited a disconcerting pictorial message: that blacks must always be masked because they probably carry a more potent form of pathogens of the coronavirus, whereas whites need not really be masked because they presumably don’t carry any pathogens of the coronavirus. The three adverts that were meant to encourage South Africans to vaccinate show two photographs of an African and Asian man masked, whereas the photograph of a white woman is shown unmasked: by any definition in any society that seeks to stamp out subliminal racism in advertising, this is racism. It must be bluntly called what it is, simply, white racism. Executives, senior managers whose entities operate and manage the Gautrain and their service providers who were involved in the creation, curation and approval of these adverts, should be castigated harshly. The Gauteng government, specifically Premier David Makhura, should summon the Gautrain operators to explain how and why they approved the curation and display of such despicably racist adverts on the Gautrain. If the premier is not prepared to erase all types of racial discrimination from our experience, including on the Gautrain, then perhaps our prayerful behest should be for him to give way to someone far more courageous in their crack of the whip. Facing off against racism is no staple for wimps, it is the calling of courageous hearts. At any rate, our Constitution behoves the premier of Gauteng to act decisively, rake over the coals the operators and marketing communications folks who approved these definitively racist adverts on the Gautrain. Perhaps, it can be opined, that more than half a century of state-sponsored racism could not possibly be overcome in a time span of about three decades since former president Nelson Mandela was released from prison. In other words, no change of heart can be legislated into the reality of experience. Yet, the difficulty of the task should not daunt us from such an honourable endeavour to rid our country of all forms of racial discrimination, blatant or subtle. Racism is a horrible scourge that undermines the dignity of the citizenry of our country and clearly such ads should have been curated by people with some common sense, to depict the ideal of equality and respect for human dignity expressed in our Constitution. Although we no longer have to don our masks outdoors, we still have to slap them on when travelling on the Gautrain. Perhaps, gleaning from the abominable racist ads, for the Gautrain bigwigs only black people should wear masks, while white people need not really, unless they feel the need. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Maybe, devil if I would ever know, things will change as they change, for a change. Yet, for now, the entire thing is a rosette of putrid shame. A blight. We are the worst for it. Heaven help us.\n",

      "Zanele Mashinini (1962-2021) was a polymath. He painted artworks of protest, scripted stage plays of dissent, wrote poetic verses of defiance, designed Struggle-era rally posters, led campaigns against the HIV/Aids stigma, founded entities to advance the careers of fellow visual artists, and partook in progressive political activism to end apartheid: an avowed dedication to the creative arts as a pillar of cohesive societal renewal, ergo, an artist. Encouraged in his salad days by his working-class parents, especially his mother Ma Moloi, to pursue his artistic inclination and talent, Mashinini’s 2018 prose-poem, Women’s Month Anthem, posted on his blog –http://zanelemashinini.blogspot.com/2018/ – in praise of the dames, reads: “Greetings Queen Mothers! How do I speak to the breasts? Suckled to a point of no return, yet giving and giving on my demand, because your beautiful figure has been anything but a workhorse, light to those in search of illumination. Happy Wolmen’s Day every day.” The young Mashinini, who was educated in Soweto at the AB Xuma Primary School and later at Orlando High School in his teen years, was influenced by a variety of eminent artists, among them Gerard Sekoto, Fikile Magadlela and Basil Baqwa, who, in the 1970s, was approached by Mashinini’s grandmother to coach the then young shoot in the science of the creative arts, wrote Lehlohonolo Lehana for an online publication, Full View. In a December 4, 2019, article, “The life and struggles of artist Zanele Mashinini,” the artist told Lehana that all of his work was guided by a simple philosophy: “If others carry guns to challenge the diabolic status quo. I carry a more potent armoury: my art.” The Mashinini family home was a short walk from the Donaldson Orlando Community Centre (DOCC), in Orlando East, Soweto, which was then teeming with artistic activities. Fortuitously, the United States Information Services library helped quench Zanele Mashinini’s quest for knowledge as he plunged his nose into the authored works. Mashinini navigated his way through the years to receive instruction in visual arts, creative writing, graphic design, photojournalism, journalism and communication, and Aids management, after which he shared his knowledge and skill when he tutored children in visual arts and drama in Soweto. He blossomed as a fine artist, with exhibitions in Soweto, Alexandra, Mthatha, Cape Town, and then on to the Ivory Coast, Germany, France, United Kingdom, United States and Portugal. Yet, even as a celebrated artist and activist among his peers, a revered leader of his generation, particularly in the arts, he was much focused on the elevation of black South Africans above the Dickensian triple challenge of poverty, suppression, and privation, as he remained that life force of which George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) in Silas Marner (1861) referenced as “the old echo that lingers and refuses to be drowned”. Art was Mashinini’s weapon, as political activism through art was his commitment. As we commemorate the Soweto June 16 student uprisings, activist artists such as Mashini will be remembered as having played a pivotal role in our liberation struggle at a very tender age. His artistic design skills enabled him to employ his craft, in the 1980s, in the design of anti-apartheid promotional material for grassroots organisations. These included labour federations, underground political organisations, youth development associations and the Release Mandela Campaign. He also scripted the lyrics to the Vuka Africa single that featured about three hundred musicians, as well as the design of a South African Post Office stamp that celebrated the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations. His alma mater, Orlando High School inducted Mashinini into its Alumni Roll of Honour. Zanele Mashinini’s younger brother, Nume Mashinini, in remembrance of his sibling said: “I have never seen Zanele without a pen and paper since the days when we were young boys.” Nume said his brother was “very unconventional” in that: “He lived his life through the prism of art, a true artist. “When Zanele was about 15 years old and I was three years younger, in the 1970s, he showed us a portrait of Nelson Mandela (South Africa’s first democratically elected president who was persona non grata with the apartheid regime at the time) that he painted. “Where he got the picture of a banned individual, we didn’t know. My parents got such a fright, they hid his painting materials. Zanele then used actual coal to paint his artworks, which I thought was quite innovative.” And Mashinini had a naughty streak. “He painted cartoons of relatives who visited our home, complete with conversation bubbles of who said what to whom, which was really funny to read,” said Nume. “He (Zanele) did a lot of things in art: poetry, as an actor in stage plays, fine arts, even writing,” said his long-time mentor and friend, the graphic artist and art teacher, Soweto-based Muziwakhe Nhlabatsi, who, while a graphic designer for the Ravan Press’ Staff Rider, designed, in the pre-1994 Struggle-era, the title covers of eminent authors such as Can Themba and Mtutuzeli Matshoba. In spite of their “about 20 years” age difference, Nhlabatsi said he shared with Mashinini a camaraderie and professional understanding from when Mashinini was still a teen fascinated with all things art. “I met Zanele when he was about 14 years old.” Nhlabatsi said when, with anti-apartheid activist and publishing editor Kevin Humphrey, they started an NGO, Graphic Equalizer, for youth to be trained in graphic design, he invited Zanele to the programme, which was based in Braamfontein (Johannesburg). “We designed promotional material for the ANC and the trade unions, around 1985, mostly activists connected to the ANC, PAC and the Black Consciousness Movement.” They were compelled to shut their doors due to incessant police raids, and Kevin (Humphrey) then left the country for Britain. Though death intervened – leiomyosarcoma cancer, last year, November, about three months after his 59th birthday on August 2, before Mashinini could complete the entire stretch of his life’s mission – he is remembered as a great, yet humble, polymath whose A.D. is worthy of the pen of history.\n",

      "In this special report we look at Roadlink boss Allan Reddy and his headline-grabbing bus service Burnt-out staff get peanuts \\'They are always on the road to augment their salaries by working overtime\\' NASHIRA DAVIDS and SASHNI PATHER SOME SA Roadlink drivers are paid a meagre R3000 a month - forcing them to stay behind the wheel for longer, just to earn a few extra bucks. \"You can imagine the fatigue - they don\\'t have time to rest. They are always on the road to augment their salaries by working overtime,\" said Assaria Mataboge, national sector co-ordinator for the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union. Mataboge said SA Roadlink drivers earned between R3000 to R4000 a month. Bus drivers for other companies, however, were paid an average of R7000 or more. \"They don\\'t even have medical aid. The company does not subsidise them, so even if they do decide to join - with that little salary - they will not be able to afford it.\" Mataboge also said that the employees had to drive 400km and more alone and that this could contribute to fatigue and the risk of accidents. He said staff might be too intimidated to join the union. SA Roadlink CEO Allan Reddy said that pension and medical aid were voluntary but he did not confirm nor deny the amount that drivers were paid. Instead, he said it was disgruntled employees fired for fraud and theft who had made these claims. Reddy conceded that his staff were not affiliated to a union. \"If the majority of these employees do not want to join, I cannot force them.\" This week Reddy had a nasty serving of negative publicity dumped on his plate. In addition to being hauled over the coals by Western Cape transport MEC Robin Carlisle for the state of his vehicles, one of his drivers was arrested for drunk driving last Saturday, and released on bail. On Monday, the company announced that it had provisionally suspended the driver, pending an \"internal investigation\". But this is not the first time an SA Roadlink driver has been in the spotlight for drunk driving. In 2005 Charles William Vaudin was arrested for being seven times over the legal limit, but he got his job back the next year. Shortly afterwards he was involved in a smash where 12 people were killed. He was acquitted of all charges. On Tuesday, Reddy and a delegation from his company met with Western Cape MEC for community safety Lennit Max. He said law enforcement officers in the province were colluding with the media to tarnish the company\\'s image. Reddy claimed to have information that traffic officials were giving the media tip-offs before hauling his buses off the road. \"Reddy said officers made arrangements to have Roadlink on national television - as if Roadlink was the only culprits in the business,\" said Max. Reddy also claimed that a passenger overheard an officer vow to \"put (Reddy) out of business\" and that the officer had received orders from the MEC. \"I put it to him that many of the buses which were pulled off unfortunately had faults,\" said Max. Reddy responded: \"You have to factor in road conditions as well. That could set something off in the bus. That happens to all buses on our roads.\" •See Mampara on Page 6 of Review YULETIDE MASSACRE: Twelve people were killed in a 2006 Christmas Eve accident involving an SA Roadlink bus in Pietermaritzburg Picture: JACKIE CLAUSEN CONTROVERSIAL: SA Roadlink CEO Alan Reddy, accused by traffic authorities in two provinces of running an unsafe fleet of buses, claims that he is being unfairly targeted Picture: JAMES OATWAY\n",

      "FOOD FESTIVALS Our land of lekker Highlighting local produce is a great way to encourage tourism, as many South African towns have discovered. shares a round up of up-coming food festivals The South African Cheese Festival, Franschhoek What started out as a small event organised by an independent cheese maker was taken over by Agri Expo in 2002, and grown into one of the country\\'s biggest. It\\'s so popular today that this has become one of its major drawbacks - and to control the crowds the organisers have stopped selling entry at the gate. Tickets are now only available through Computicket, and it is best to purchase well before the event. For cheese lovers, it is heaven. All the large commercial cheese producers are there, so expect to find large heads of popular local SA cheeses (lots of cheddars and goudas) carved into minute blocks for the hordes to enjoy. The charm of the festival is in the small artisanal cheese-makers, who showcase their wares. The number has grown considerably over the years and the range is impressive. The festival has expanded to include a range of complementary foods like breads, olives, jams, preserves, relishes, chocolates and, of course, wine. The best way to enjoy the festival is to visit on a weekday, preferably, and pick up a range of foodstuffs to make your own picnic to enjoy under the trees, where chairs and tables are laid out - and entertainment is provided. An interactive demonstration kitchen featuring a number of the country\\'s top chefs and food personalities is another popular feature of the festival. April 24 - 27 Bien Donné, Franschhoek10am - 6pm daily, but it closes at 5pm on the last day.Tickets: R110 for Saturday and Sunday, R90 for Monday and Tuesday.Senior citizens: R70.Children under 12 get in free.For more information, visit www.cheesefestival.co.za Lamberts Bay Crayfish & Cultural Festival A couple of hours from Cape Town up the West Coast is the coastal town of Lamberts Bay. Famous for its long stretches of white beaches and Bird Island (home to Cape Gannet), it is well known as the crayfish Mecca of the country. This year marks their ninth crayfish festival, which takes place soon after the crayfish season closes. Of course, crayfish are in abundance at the festival and the organisers have got it down to a fine art. At their venue on the outskirts of the town, the crayfish are cooked in large black pots and then roasted over the coals. Prepared in West-coast style, the crayfish cost R70 and are served with two sauces, boiled potatoes and green salad. Fresh oysters will also be on sale at R10 per oyster. If crayfish is not your thing, the local Muisbosskerm restaurant will be serving paella, and there will be other food stalls. The festival has been extended to include over 100 stalls and a big attraction is the music festival, which this year includes Steve Hofmeyer in the line-up. As is the festival custom, on Sunday morning they hold an interdenominational thanksgiving service. April 22-25 Ticket price includes entrance to the music festival.Thursday: 6pm onwards, R40 for adults and R20 for children (3 -11 years).Friday: From 9am, R100 for adults, R50 for children. Saturday: From 8am, R140 for adults and R50 for children. Sunday: 9am church service. The festival opens at 11am, free entrance.For more information, visit www.kreeffees.com Riebeek Valley Olive Festival In a region famous for its olives, olive oils and wines the picturesque sister towns of Riebeek Kasteel and Riebeek West will be hosting their 10th Riebeek Valley Olive Festival. Unlike most other festivals, the event does not take place under one roof but involves 23 pit-stops on the specially designed festival route map. It is the perfect chance to soak up the ambience of this beautiful region and sample the new-season olive oils, including the famous Kloovenburg range. There will be lots of interesting products to taste and buy, including olive jams and relishes; and table olives cured in a number of different ways, like green manzanilla olives in a lime dressing, shiraz-infused olives and even an olive chocolate salami. April 30 - May 2For more information, visit www.riebeekvalley.info The Prince Albert Festival In the hamlet of Prince Albert, the townsfolk annually celebrate all this fertile valley has to offer. It is a community event and you can feel the spirit of unity as everyone comes together to share their best produce. Take a stroll down the main street and check out what the locals are selling at their stalls set up specially for the two days. The organisers always have a number of fun events, which draw the crowds. A highlight is the olive-spitting competition. The local street band adds to the carnival spirit, as does the vintage-car parade and, last year, the circus school came to town. Prince Albert offers plenty of accommodation for visitors and there are many restaurants and coffee shops. Don\\'t forget to visit the local olive farms and watch the new-season olive-oil pressing. Wine tasting can be done at the smallest wine farm in the centre of the town, Soet Karoo, or head off to Bergwater Wine Estate for their quality reds and whites. Africa\\'s largest fig farm, Weltevrede, opens its doors to the public during the festival and the small town boasts its own cookery school, African Relish, which is drawing both local and international visitors to the Karoo town.

      "FOOD ONE ON ONE A Carnaval of flavours Chef Jean-Yves Poirey was in Jo\\'burg recently to whip up dishes for the Brazilian food festival. spoke to him You\\'re a French chef heading up the kitchen in one of Rio de Janeiro\\'s largest hotels. How did this come about? I\\'ve worked in Brazil for some 25 years now and have worked at the Rio Orthon Palace Hotel for three years. I have my roots in that country. I\\'m married to a Belgian woman and my two daughters have grown up in Brazil. You have worked around the world. Have you been to South Africa before? I\\'ve never been to South Africa but have worked in Nigeria and The Gambia. I find the mix of cultures here very interesting. In many ways, it is like Brazil, which is also made up of many different cultures. What were some of the surprises you had for South African diners? We prepared many traditional Brazilian dishes. Brazil is made up of different regions: in the south there are large Italian and German influences and it\\'s quite European. In the north, there are strong African, Indian and Portuguese influences. We featured dishes from all the regions. Much of the food is cooked using palm oil and coconut milk. Is Brazilian food spicy? No, but we do make a hot pepper sauce using the malagueta pepper. This is served on the side and is never added to the food during cooking. I\\'m sure this is an African/Indian influence. What is the staple food in Brazil? Cassava. It comes dry or grated and is made into a flour. Brazilians make a cassava meal known as a farofa, which is a toasted flour mixture made by frying the flour in butter, salt and bacon until golden brown. This forms part of the daily Brazilian diet. Farofa is the essential accompaniment to feijoada completa, the Brazilian national dish. It is served alongside the dish and sprinkled on by the individual diner. It is also served on top of beans and rice and used as a stuffing for poultry. Feijoada completa is made from black beans and a combination of meats. Where did it originate? Feijoada is a rich, dark and very heavy dish made up of beef, sausages, bacon and pork. It originated in Rio de Janeiro and is recognised as the national dish of Brazil. It is traditionally served with rice, sliced oranges and kale. The oranges serve to balance the richness of the meal. Brazil is famous for its beef. How is it best prepared? Brazil is a large cattle-producing country and they produce top-quality beef. The Brazilians are famous for churrascaria, a barbecue, where the meat is cooked over charcoal. Large cuts of beef are threaded onto long metal swords or skewers, which are supported by metal rods over the hot coals. The meat is covered in rock salt and cooked slowly to retain the moisture and flavour. When cooked, it is sliced from the skewers onto plates. Brazilians have a strong culture of coffee and beer. What about wine? In the 1980s, when I first arrived in the country, there was very little wine - maybe two or three different types. Now there are many vineyards in the country producing very good wine. Did you arrive in SA with special cooking equipment or ingredients? No, Brazilian ingredients can be found around the world. I even found cassava here in Johannesburg. Bafana Bafana coach Carlos Parreira is Brazilian. Have you cooked for him? Many years ago, I cooked for him. Football is like a religion in Brazil. Everyone knows everything about football and has a team they will support for life. •The Brazilian Food Festival was held at Emperors Palace Hotel in Johannesburg recently. Next month a group of chefs from the hotel will fly to Rio de Janeiro to take part in a South African Food Festival at the Rio Orthon Palace Hotel.

      "THE TIMES EXPLORER: WILD COAST How green was their valley On the last leg of the journey, marvels at the roaring seas, intense skies and mesmerising, er, grass of the Wild Coast \\' Fishing off the rocks. Eating kabeljou and shad every other day \\' In a place as exquisite as this, there is no reason to inhale. It\\'s as chill as it gets \\'FAIRY tales can come true, they can happen to you, if you\\'re young at heart,\" Tom Waits gurgles happily as the Times Explorer team rounds the final ascending bend on the shocking road from Mthatha that leads to Coffee Bay, so named after a ship carrying a cargo of beans up the coast fell foul of a storm in 1863 and dumped its load on the beach. The locals also call it Tshontini, after an indigenous forest that clings tenaciously to the slopes of a hillside overlooking the bay. \"Picture, picture, picture,\" photographer Kevin Sutherland exclaims. Multimedia journalist Vumani Mkhize is hot on his heels out of the vehicle. Below us, framed to the right by Sugar Loaf Hill and at the head of the Nenga, river of the whale, lies the bay. I am bereft, yet again, of speech. \"Do you want to go to the Wild Coast, Dude?\" my editor asked. Fans of The Big Lebowski - Joel and Ethan Coen\\'s classic buddy-flick homage to being chill and the vital role in male bonding played by bowling - will take note of the \"Dude\". \"Already packed.\" Deadpan. \"Day after tomorrow.\" Cut to 1980, matric geography class. \"What grows in the Transkei\" \"Sir!\" \"Sir!\" \"Sir!\" \"Correct. And can anyone tell me why?\" \"So that we can smoke it, sir!\" \"Aren\\'t we the class clown today? \"Just kidding, sir\" And then followed one of those lessons that define the word teach. Using the findings of the research for a master\\'s dissertation on the Transkei\\'s dagga economy, Sir explained that the blame lay squarely with the apartheid puppets who governed for their masters the so-called homeland called the Transkei - for continuing to throw almost its entire, feeble budget for agriculture at an unsuitable, white model of monoculture farming. For failing with the sort of stupidly dogged determination that more than suggested corruption to recognise that low-margin, labour-intensive farming in a cattle-based culture was going to find few backers in a race against a highly sought-after, untaxed cash crop. For insisting with criminal obduracy to imagine that the indignity and horror of migrant labour in South Africa was preferable to a comfortable, albeit illegal, place in the dagga economy. Fully 85% of the Transkei economy not provided in the form of handouts by Pretoria was generated by dagga, the research showed. And then we watched a slide show of a hike he\\'d undertaken south from Port St Johns to Coffee Bay. Wild. And soberingly beautiful. Geography was a breath of fresh air and a privilege amid the stale, monolithic pronouncements that passed for education in the \\'80s. More than 10 years passed before I made a trip to the Wild Coast. To Coffee Bay, there to walk the coast, camp and, by turn, to be stilled by the roar of the sea as it carved spectacular, improbable monuments to its power, such as the Hole in the Wall. To be refreshed by the vastness and intense blue sky. To be humbled by the desperate beauty and fierce pride of a culture eking out a living under apartheid. And altogether more prosaically, to relish the seafood - shad, crayfish and mussels cooked on the coals of a fire, oysters eaten on the rocks. For two days the team is tantalised by glimpses of a longer stay. Fishing off the rocks. Eating kabeljou and shad every other day and crayfish more often than once a decade. Routine walks on the wide flats of the beach. Young families abandoning themselves to the pleasures of building sand castles and tentatively pushing podgy fingers into sea anemones. Backpackers from all over the world, aglow with rude health, hiking, making jembe drums, learning to surf and partying. Of meeting, and getting to know, oddball owners of backpackers\\' lodges, who offer you lunch, forgetting that the kitchen is closed because the chef is not on duty, and then, without missing a beat, charm you into returning for a party, maybe a meal, that evening. Flashes of inspiration and hope such as Kaya Lethu (Our Place), where our hosts at Coram Deo guest house, Gerrie and Christine Maritz, have established a pre-school for children \"infected or affected\" by HIV/Aids. In the afternoons, Kaya Lethu operates as a library for older children who attend the primary school over the road. Similarly, at Hole in the Wall, where a representative of the Eastern Cape government recruited women to work in a job-creation project involving maintenance of the beaches on this incomparable stretch of the legendarily stormy coast. And indomitable women bending and rising from the waist as they first work and then pack clay of just the right texture into moulds for the bricks that will become a new home. As for dagga, yes it is a part of the scene and by some accounts a great and valuable attraction. By other accounts, it remains a scourge. But no matter how you argue the issue, what is undeniable is that in a place as awe-inspiring and gobsmackingly exquisite as this, there is no real reason to inhale. It\\'s already as chill as it gets, Dude. The Times Explorer team leaves Coffee Bay doubling back on the route by which it entered. Without exception, we each vow to return. If fairy tales do come true, and one happens to me, it will be to stay. And be young at heart. •Read the Times Explorer at http:/explorer.timeslive.co.za.

      "Death threat as ANC, labour clash Cosatu warned its general secretary will die after comments on graft in high places ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION NKULULEKO NCANA and BRUCE GORTON THE general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), Zwelinzima Vavi, has received a letter containing a death threat, the union reports. The federation said the letter reads: \"You will die like Molefi.\" The union said this was presumed to be a reference to Molefi Sefularo, the South African deputy minister of health who died in a car accident outside Pretoria on April 5 this year. \"This could imply that the writer knows that it was not an accident,\" Cosatu said. It said the letter had been referred to the head of the SA Police Service, General Bheki Cele, for investigation. \"But we also know that the best protection against such threats is the support of the masses,\" said the union. It said it had no reason to associate the letter with the ANC national working committee\\'s decision to take disciplinary action against its general secretary, but also said it was not taking the threat lightly, particularly in view of murders in the province of Mpumalanga and elsewhere that appeared to be targeting people blowing the whistle on corruption. \"The federation will not, however, be driven to panic or paranoia by this letter. \"No amount of death threats or blackmail will cause us to scale down or abandon our campaign to end corruption,\" the federation concluded. Revelations about the death threat follow recent calls by Vavi for officials accused of corruption to be investigated. When he was asked - after reading out a statement to this effect following a Cosatu central executive committee meeting - to give examples of corrupt officials, Vavi named SA minister of communications Siphiwe Nyanda and minister of local government Sicelo Shiceka. Shiceka is reported to have faked his CV, while Nyanda has been tied to various companies that have won large government tenders - such as GNS Risk Advisory Services, of which he holds 50%. It has also been reported that Nyanda spent R500000 on accommodation at luxury Cape Town hotels while waiting for his state-owned residence to be renovated. On Thursday Nyanda threatened to sue Vavi over his utterances. Nyanda\\'s lawyers sent a letter to Vavi demanding that he publish a retraction of his \"defamatory\" statement and apologise to him for referring to him as \"a corrupt minister\". The letter, in turn, came a day after Vavi sent a strongly worded missive to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe who, it was said, was in the process of hauling the Cosatu leader over the coals for his statements. Vavi wrote to Mantashe warning that a decision to bring disciplinary charges against him - something that had reportedly been decided upon by the ANC\\'s national working committee - would create a dangerous precedent. \"This decision would imply... that any member of Cosatu or other organisations ... who join the ANC would have to disown his or her original organisation and accept only the discipline of the ANC,\" Vavi said in the letter. Nyanda\\'s lawyer, Siyabonga Mahlangu, said he had received instructions to pursue legal action against Vavi in his \"personal and official capacity\" should he not apologise by next Thursday. \"The publication of your statements ... constitutes a gross violation of our client\\'s right to his good name and reputation and is per se defamatory,\" Mahlangu wrote. \"We have been instructed to demand... that you publish ... an unqualified retraction of any reference or insinuation that our client is a corrupt individual or corrupt minister, accompanied by an unqualified apology to our client. \"We demand that you do so in the same medium and manner in which you published the defamatory remarks and advise you that you have done so before close of business on 10 June 2010, failing which we hold instructions to commence legal action against you.\" Cosatu spokesman Patrick Craven said he did not know \"anything\" about the letter. He said, however, that Nyanda\\'s lawyers had \"obviously not read\" the Cosatu statement that Vavi had quoted from, and that Nyanda and his lawyers \"obviously got it wrong\". \"He (Vavi) was reading from the statement and these were examples of ministers in the media against whom allegations have been levelled,\" Craven said. He said that at no stage did Vavi allege that the two ministers were corrupt. - Additional reporting by I-Net Bridge CREDENTIALS: The SA minister of local government, Sicelo Shiceka Picture:SOWETAN TENDERS: The SA minister of communications, Siphiwe Nyanda Picture:TREVOR SAMSON THREATS: General secretary of the Congress of SA Trade Unions, Zwelinzima Vavi Picture: RUSSELL ROBERTS\n",

      "A guiding light of township tourism Tourists are flocking to Wandu @ Ekasi, once a tiny RDP house \\'I want this township to develop its own brand and identity just like Soweto\\' WHILE five-star hotels roll out the red carpet for soccer dignitaries and stars, Mawande Kondlo is welcoming them into his bedroom - which has been converted into a township bar and restaurant. Kondlo lives in the impoverished township of Khayalethu, which overlooks Knysna where the national soccer teams from Denmark and France will be staying at luxury resorts. The 35-year-old tour guide\\'s home, once a tiny cement block RDP house, but now proudly known as Wandu @ Ekasi, is fast becoming a tourist magnet on the Garden Route. Among the guests to have dined under the cane ceiling are a Danish 2010 Fifa World Cup delegation, including the country\\'s ambassador Dan Frederiksen, Steen Dahrup, manager of the Danish national team, and Knysna mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies. \"Dahrup ate a beef roosterkoek (bread dough roasted over the coals) and asked for another one immediately. He will never forget it,\" said Kondlo. The restaurant serves South African favourites such as liver, and umphokoqo namasi (pap and sour milk). Steel plates filled with nuts and Karoo biltong welcome guests. Next week the father of two will take 20 Japanese tourists staying in George - where their national soccer team is based - on a tour to Oudtshoorn. Although the restaurant, which is still his family home, is part of a township peppered with informal wooden homes and shacks, it commands a prime piece of real estate because of its location - on a hill-top with majestic views of the Knysna Heads. Kondlo last year hosted an \"intimate wedding\" for a German couple who requested samp and beans and pap en vleis for their menu. The business is thriving and Kondlo hopes to develop the property into a guest house. He said he was inundated with calls from clients who wanted to sleep in the township. Tourists eager to experience township life had even spent the night, sleeping in his son\\'s bedroom, he said. Kondlo guides tourists around the township, to taste umqombothi (traditional beer) and to consult a local sangoma. But, he said, only about 5% of his clients were locals. \"I\\'m doing this to try to show visitors that things are changing in the township. When they drive along the N2 all they see is shacks. They don\\'t realise that there are people here and that there is development. Some even ask if it\\'s safe to come in here,\" Kondlo said. \"Most importantly I want to preserve our culture. I want this township to develop its own brand and identity - just like Soweto.\" Kondlo grew up in Oudtshoorn and moved to Knysna hoping to find a job there in 1995. He first worked as a petrol attendant and later a porter at one of the town\\'s hotels. \"I developed a love for tourism while working as a porter ... and was later promoted to night receptionist. I used to admire tour guides and tour operators at the hotel. I asked them how I could get into the industry and they said I could study. I then quit my job and opened my own tour company, taking tourists to the Cango Caves in Oudtshoorn and the Crags in Plettenberg Bay. \"I used my small Toyota Tazz but when I got more clients I had to hire a bigger vehicle,\" he said. Three teams playing in the World Cup will be based in the southern Cape. Denmark is staying at the Simola Hotel & Country Club and Spa, while France is booked into the Pezula Hotel in Knysna. Japan has elected to stay at the Fancourt Hotel & Country Club in George. Bouw-Spies said that despite Knysna hosting two World Cup teams, it was not expecting many French and Danish visitors during the tournament. \"The teams told us not to expect thousands of their supporters to come to town. But we are not worried because the benefits will be post-2010 - as well as the exposure,\" she said. nombembepsundaytimes.co.za WANTS ROOMS WITH A VIEW: Mawande Kondlo, owner of Wandu @ Ekasi resturant in Khayalethu, Knysna Picture: MOEKETSI MOTICOE\n",

      "Wine Side BAR NEIL PENDOCK Opportunity in adversity Some distillers are already well prepared for an advertising ban WHEN the roof of the Glenfiddich distillery warehouse in Speyside collapsed under the weight of four foot of snow in January last year, malt master Brian Kinsman had a wee problem. What to do with the Oloroso sherry casks and American oak barrels full of maturing spirit, exposed to the night sky and -19°C temperatures? Necessity being the mother of invention, a unique limited edition was blended to celebrate the pioneering spirit of making whisky in extreme conditions. As Kinsman recalls: \"A photographer came to film the roof collapse and when we looked at the pictures, the light shining through the warehouse roofs looked like a phoenix rising above us. I suppose this was the moment of conception of Glenfiddich Snow Phoenix.\" The bleak arctic scene is captured in the stark monochrome packaging; each bottle is presented in a coal-black tin. And timeous too, as the five cases of whisky abandoned by Ernest Shackleton during his abortive expedition to the South Pole a century ago have recently been retrieved and are in the news. The new brand is appropriately named after the phoenix, the bird from Greek mythology that emerges from the flames, while whisky gets life from the peated fires used to distill fiery spirit out of a weak beer fermented from malted barley. This bird has arrived in the nick of time for advertising agencies as a ban on alcohol advertising is threatened in the UK and SA. The mission is to transform alcoholic beverages from commodities, like soap powder and toothpaste advertised in magazines and on billboards, into lifestyle issues discussed in features like this one. The Great Warehouse Collapse of 2010 is one mission accomplished and 1200 bottles will soon be arriving in SA and offered at R600 each. Bottled at cask strength of 47.6% alcohol by volume, this is a bird of ferocious intensity. Consumers can stand by for a flock of such fortuitous brands as a subtle redirection of alcohol ad-spend is under way. Brandhouse/Diageo woke up early, smelt the floral notes of regulation and are already moving their advertising \"below the line\" as the Johnnie Walker sponsorship of the 10th SA Cheese Festival this weekend confirms. Snow Phoenix\\'s tasting notes were developed by those other rescue specialists in extreme climes, the Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team. Since they are peppered with Scottishisms like \"heather honey\", I poured a wee dram for a brace of Cape Town coffee kings, David Donde from TRUTH.coffeecult and freelance coffee bean roaster Jake Easton, who has made some fine artisanal cider in his time. \"Like wine, but better,\" said Easton, \"with that structural bitterness on the finish like Campari.\" \"Very promising. Maple syrup on the nose rather than honey,\" opined Donde, \"with an unexpected peatiness on the palate. The most interesting Glenfiddich this side of the 25-year-old.\" A revolutionary spirit to be sure and, without advertising, a taste of things to come. •Read Pendock Uncorked at http:/blogs.thetimes.co.za/pendock TOO MUCH TO HANDLE: The roof of the Glenfiddich distillery warehouse caved in after a snow storm, and right, David Donde of TRUTH.coffeecult with a dram of Snow Phoenix KICKER: Cognac caption caption and herye pse\n",

      "Our Kind of Food DOUBLE ACT Retired radio personality Jeremy Mansfield and his wife Jacqui have launched the second cookbook, \\'Zhoozsh! Faking it\\'. speaks to them about food and life after broadcasting Your second cookbook has just been published. Where did it start? Jacqui: I\\'m still mystified by the attraction of cooking. I can\\'t cook and avoid the kitchen. Unless you give me a detailed recipe with a photograph, I won\\'t even start. Jeremy: When Jacqui puts her mind to it she does a good job. I grew up on a pineapple farm in the Eastern Cape and there was always something cooking in our kitchen. Agnes, our helper, always had a big pot of samp and beans bubbling on the stove. She would lift me up onto the counter and I would help her serve. Can you remember the first thing you cooked? Jacqui: My mother hated cooking. My first food memory is of mashed boiled eggs my mother would leave for lunch for my sister and me in white porcelain teacups. Horrible - I don\\'t think there was any salt and pepper. I do remember making jelly though - until a friend told me it was made from horses\\' hooves and I\\'ve never eaten it again. Jeremy: My first dish was samp and beans. I remember cooking things for my parents but what they were, I\\'m not sure. I\\'m a frustrated chef really - and today an honorary member of the South African Chefs Association. Cooking or broadcasting? Jeremy: Cooking! The best decision I ever made was to take myself off air. I had been on radio for 25 years, 13 of them with 94.7 Highveld Stereo. I\\'m living a totally new life although I\\'m still working behind the scenes (on radio). It really struck me how my lifestyle has changed when a friend recently invited me to join him on a houseboat on Kariba on the spur the moment and I said, \"Cool, let\\'s go!\" Best ingredient? Jacqui: Cream, I know it is such a girl answer. You can fix anything with cream. Jeremy: Fresh rosemary. We have it growing in the back garden. I don\\'t use it often but when I do, I love it. Take out or eat in? Jacqui: Eat in without a doubt. I do love Wimpy coffee though. Jeremy: We don\\'t eat fast food. These days one is never sure what goes into food. I don\\'t eat a lot of meat or chicken (Jacqui is a vegetarian) and if I do, it must be free range or organic. It is becoming difficult to eat out unless you know the restaurant and the quality of ingredients they are using. I do remember ordering a Scooters pizza once - for my dogs. It was after a visit to the vet. I asked for the pizza to be topped with all the meat they could find - salami, ham, fillet - the dogs loved it. Is there anything you absolutely dislike? Jacqui: Liver. When I was a child, my stepmother would cook the stuff. She locked me in the dining room until I had finished eating it. Jeremy: I\\'m not mad about offal. Having said that, I did enjoy haggis in Scotland. Food secrets? Jacqui: I learnt from a chef that the best way to check if oil is ready for frying is to stand a wooden chopstick in the oil. If the oil bubbles around the stick, it is ready. Jeremy: Sushi rice vinegar. Used as a salad dressing it is so easy and so tasty. Not oily and it offers such a fresh taste. What is your favourite foodie travel destination? Jacqui: Vietnam because it is so easy to be vegetarian. Jeremy: Definitely Vietnam - the food tastes so fresh. They don\\'t use coconut milk in their cooking so it is not as rich. I will never forget a cooking course we did in Hoi An. It was at a tiny restaurant near the river. The chef prepared a five-course meal over a tiny fire made with a handful of coals, two bricks and a grill. It was fantastic. I was frantically taking notes while he cooked. Mind boggling, really. Self-catering or luxury holidays? Jacqui: We both love to travel. I work to travel. We are both adventurous and enjoy mixed holidays - really roughing, it like hiking, with a bit of luxury at the end. Jeremy plans the best holidays. I remember the looks we got travelling first class on Cathay Pacific with backpacks! And the joy of fresh, hot bread on one of our trips in Zimbabwe. We came to a little town and stopped at the local shop. The shelves were empty but there was bread, half loaves. We pulled over, made some tea and enjoyed the bread with hot, sweet tea. Jeremy: I\\'m the best person to travel with. I love the planning and organising all the food for a trip. For the first few days we have the fresh stuff and then we move on to the dry goods. I take things like brown and white rice and lentils and these days there are many good convenience items on the market. It\\'s a skill to plan the meals for a trip. And I have a knack of \"zhoozshing\" up food. It\\'s a skill really. Things like organic liquid stock and good salt make the difference. If your kitchen was on fire, what piece of equipment would you grab? Jacqui: Jeremy! Jeremy: My wok. I bought it in Hong Kong and strapped it onto my backpack. Your first cookbook Zhoozsh! was hugely successful, picking up a Gourmand Award overseas. What cookbook has been your greatest influence? Jeremy: Lynn Bedford Hall\\'s Best of Cooking. It is filled with simple, straightforward tasty recipes. If you want something great for a group of friends you will find it there - starters, mains and desserts. What are some things should every cook should know? Jacqui: Know where the fire extinguisher is; don\\'t be alarmed by flames and a pot lid will snuff out almost anything. Jeremy: Don\\'t under-estimate tofu; it\\'s great for menopausal women. If your dish is too salty, add peeled, chopped potatoes; lemon or lime juice will reduce the heat (spiciness) of a curry. Is there any dish you have failed to master? Jacqui: After many years I have mastered a few meals, mainly desserts, but not Baked Alaska. Jeremy: I\\'m not great at making mash. My mother\\'s mash is always creamy and fluffy without any lumps. I can\\'t do it. You are savvy when it comes to whipping up quick meals. How did this come about? Jacqui: I don\\'t know. I don\\'t like a mess. If I can use one pot then I\\'ve succeeded. Jeremy: I love food preparation - it gives me the ability to relax. I use my imagination a lot and I use it well. I create a recipe in my head, imagining what it will taste like with various ingredients until I can taste what the dish will be like. I do believe imitating and faking things on air for 25 years has given me great insight into faking things in the kitchen. It\\'s about producing or replicating something that makes people think you spent an awful lot of money or an awful lot of time in preparing the meal they see before them. Pick a recipe in your latest cookbook that reflects you Jacqui: The Feefa Whirld Cup Balls. I simply adore chocolate and can make them for myself as a meal. Jeremy: Boere Breyani because it is so wholesome and warming and incredibly tasty. It was created by my friend Anton la Grange when we cooked together on a TV show and represents friendship, comfort and nurturing. •Zhoozsh!

      "Food Advice Grill HILLS HILARY BILLER Send your food queries to food@sundaytimes.co.za TUCK INTO THIS BREAD Recipe Q I have been reading an Australian novel and there are many references to damper, a bread. The Oxford Dictionary describes it as pad for silencing a piano string - or a movable metal plate used to regulate the air flow in a chimney - but no reference to bread. Do you have an explanation and a recipe, please? - Harry Goldstone, Berea, Durban A The Oxford Dictionary explanation - though it is not for the bread - is not far off the mark. A damper is a simple soda bread made with flour, salt, water and bicarbonate of soda. Eaten straight from the oven it is delicious with lots of butter. But it\\'s not as pleasant once it cools when it becomes quite hard - not good for the teeth and really only good for toasting. Australian in origin, it is commonly referred to as bush tucker - tucker being Aussie slang for food. Damper is said to have been developed by stockmen who travelled the countryside. With a few simple ingredients, the bread could be made in the fire. It would first be placed on top of the coals to form a crust, then buried in them to bake through. It is very similar to the Irish soda bread or the Mozambican pão which is also cooked in the fire. Today, no Australian barbie is complete without a damper - except that these days it is more likely to have been baked in the oven. Over the years, the simple damper has been adapted to include potato, herbs, spices, vegetables, cheese and other interesting ingredients. It is quick and easy to make and I think our South African beer bread is a close cousin. Using beer instead of water or milk, it is the yeast in the beer that gives the bread the edge. Below is a standard recipe close to the original, except for the addition of butter and milk, which makes it even better. Feel free to add flavourants like herbs, cheese or spices - even chopped olives - but no more than a cupful. DAMPER Ingredients: 750ml (3 cups) self-raising flour 60g (4 tbsp) butter 5ml (1 tsp) salt 250ml (1 cup) milk Approximately 60ml (4 tbsp) water Method: In a large mixing bowl, sift the flour and salt together. Cut the butter into cubes and rub into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in the milk and the water. Use a round-bladed knife to mix the dough together. Shape into a round loaf or two smaller round loaves. Place on a greased baking tray, dust with a little extra flour and bake at 180°C for 20-30 minutes depending on the size. The bread will sound hollow when tapped on the bottom when cooked. Boudoir\\'s back I have received many queries from readers regarding the non-availability of Bakers Boudoir biscuits. For months there were none in supermarkets - and if you were lucky enough to find a packet, you knew they had been lying around for a long time. When I contacted Bakers I was told to wait for May when all would be revealed. Well, the secret is out, Bakers has been refining the recipe and the biscuit is now \"bigger and better\", according to their press statement. In its absence I discovered the imported Italian savoiardi biscuit filled the gap perfectly. Easily sourced from my local supermarket, they were cheaper than the local biscuit. The new Boudoir biscuit is fatter and more like the savoiardi original.\n",

      "Reader\\'s Recipe Simple DELIGHT hankers after holidays in the country and pizza made with beer Recipe WHEN I was growing up my family, their friends and I would spend the odd weekend in Bonnievale. It was the perfect country escape from Cape Town, where we lived. We stayed in a cottage named \"Suikerhuisie\", which was owned by friends of my grandfather. It had no electricity so all our cooking was done using gas or over coals. We braaied daily and I can still remember waking up with the smell of smoke in my hair. There was a large cement pizza oven outside that the parents would bake beer bread in while we children read by candlelight, played night-time cricket, teased the bulls in the field and munched the leftover dough. My parents and I soon realised we could make pizzas using the same recipe and so began our heritage of beer-bread pizza - we kids revelled in adding the weirdest of toppings - which we still make whenever on holiday in the countryside. I\\'ve started introducing the recipe to close ones and make sure they remember who they got it from. They all say it\\'s the best pizza base they have ever tasted and it\\'s so quick and easy to make. BEER-BREAD PIZZA (Makes 8 pizzas) Ingredients: 3 x 500g self raising flour 3 x 340ml bottles of beer 15ml (3 tsp) salt Tomato paste Mozzarella cheese, grated Toppings: Salami, ham, olives, mushrooms, peppers, onion slices, bacon, banana, sundried tomatoes and any tasty leftovers in the fridge Method: Mix the flour, beer and salt together in a big bowl with a wooden spoon. Knead with your hands, using flour to stop it sticking until you have an elastic dough. Add more flour if too sticky. Roll dough out on counter top into rounds using a rolling pin and place dough into a greased pizza pan. Brush tomato paste over dough first, then grated cheese and selected toppings. Bake in a preheated oven at 190°C for 10-15 minutes. Picture: RAYMOND PRESTON\n",

      "\\'Til the hit man do them part... TENESHIA NAIDOO TWO local playwrights have written a spoof on spousal murders after being inspired by the high-profile cases of Najwa Petersen and Pietermaritzburg killer Kalisha Rajcoomar. Veteran actor Vivian Moodley and Ruben Naidoo\\'s new play, Murder My Husband Please, is a farcical take on husbands and wives who murder their spouses. The playwrights began writing the story in December after following the numerous accounts of spousal murders in the press. \"When you read these stories, you realise how ridiculous some of the attempts are,\" said Moodley. \"I wondered what went through the minds of these people, who think they can get away with it.\" Naidoo said they realised that recounting the \"ridiculous attempts\" people came up with would make a \"funny\" play. A few of the recent high-profile murders which inspired the play include the 2006 murder of Taliep Petersen by his wife, Najwa. She was convicted of hiring two men to break into their house and kill her husband and to make it look like a robbery. Another case that served as inspiration was the Pietermaritzburg murder of Sandesh Poorun by the mother of his child, Kalisha Rajcoomar, and her husband, Amith Sewkarran. The pair, convicted in 2009, lured him to a hotel where they plied him with alcohol, strangled him and then burnt the body. Moodley said he remembered reading that the couple had purchased charcoal to burn the body and he was surprised at the lengths people went to. \"As writers, we come up with creative ideas all the time, but these people (Rajcoomar and Sewkarran) somewhere along the line in their \\'creative way\\' decided to buy coal to burn a body. It\\'s ridiculous.\" Murder My Husband Please, which will be staged at Sibaya Casino this week , revolves around married couple Krish (Naidoo) and Dhanum (Moodley). Krish has an affair with their femme fatal neighbour Soundler (Samantha Govender), but Dhanum finds out. Moodley said the story line was also inspired by the Merebank murder case of Bharat Lutchman. Dayalan Reddy and his cousin, Durban butcher Rajen Chetty, were convicted in April of the murder after they tried to secure payment of a R6-million life policy. Moodley said it was not their intention to be malicious or insensitive but they wanted to create debate in the community. Lutchman\\'s brother, Roy, said he did not have a problem with the writers using his brother\\'s story for the play. But Poorun\\'s sister, Varsha, refused to comment. Advice Desk for the Abused board member Pramodh Singh said domestic violence was a huge concern, adding it would be helpful if the play brought out the message that marital issues can be addressed and that murder was not an option.

What\\'s on it: The Clubhouse burger comes \"Dagwood style\" with a 200g pure beef burger, bacon, a fried egg and a cheesy jalapeno sauce. It\\'s served with potato chips or a side salad with olives and feta. For more modest appetites, the standard Bona Fide burger will do. Price: Clubhouse R69; Bona Fide R59, Chicken R57.

      "Turok hauled over coals at caucus Stance on bill angers colleagues CAIPHUS KGOSANA VETERAN ANC MP Ben Turok had a torrid time at a special party caucus meeting on Thursday - with his colleagues demanding that he be disciplined and that his political education courses be boycotted. The special caucus was hastily arranged after it emerged that Turok had walked out the National Assembly before the Protection of State Information Bill was voted on. Fellow ANC MP Gloria Borman abstained. On Thursday, ANC MPs condemned Turok\\'s actions. They were particularly irked by his comments in a radio interview to the effect that they had been given the wrong version of the bill to vote on. Several MPs who attended the caucus meeting said Turok was not in the Old Assembly chamber when the meeting started and that chief whip Mathole Motshekga instructed his assistant to summon him. \"When he arrived it was very tense. Members were very angry, they said he must be disciplined for what he did and what he said on the radio,\" said an MP who asked not to be named. He said the general view was that Turok\\'s decision to walk out would have not drawn such condemnation if he hadn\\'t made the comments about MPs having voted without reading the draft law. MP Pam Tshwete was given a round of applause when she urged MPs to boycott Turok\\'s University of Cape Town-accredited political education course. Another MP, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Blade Nzimande, intervened, advising MPs against discussing issues of discipline in caucus as this could prejudice any disciplinary action against members. Motshekga told journalists after the meeting that he had briefly met Turok and Borman to seek an explanation. He said an investigation would be launched to determine their reasons for not toeing the line. \"Should the information gathered in the investigation warrant disciplinary action, the matter will be referred to the disciplinary committee,\" he said. Turok said yesterday that he had missed the early part of the meeting as he was flying back from Bloemfontein where he delivered a lecture on Wednesday. He said he was not aware that MPs had expressed outrage at his actions. \"Yes, I did get a call from the chief whip\\'s assistant to say I must come to caucus. I didn\\'t know there was a row going on. I was dealing with other matters. Nobody said anything to me about any criticism. No one gave me any indication that there had been criticism,\" he said. Turok said he still had reservations about the bill and had communicated these to Motshekga when they met on Thursday. \"What I said to him is that I have been an ANC MP for 17 years and I have never once voted against the ANC or abstained on any votes. \"On this occasion I felt the need not to be part of that vote. I did not vote against, I didn\\'t abstain, I merely left the chamber. What I said is that we need more time to discuss this bill.\" Borman said she had reservations about the bill, particularly the exclusion of a public interest defence. If it became law, she said, the bill would make it difficult for investigative journalists to expose corruption in government. Another ANC MP, Salam Abram, who was absent during the vote, said he would have abstained in protest at the proposed legislation. He said he was ready to face the music for his comments. Caucus insiders said Abram was an unpopular MP from the Free State who is known to be close to COPE president Mosiuoa Lekota. Abram serves on the agriculture, forestry and fisheries portfolio committee and often has run-ins with Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson. The sources said the minister had complained to Motshkega about him. BEN TUROK\n",

      "Something Elsje remains If you want to see how wine was made in the Cape 50 years ago, visit Altydgedacht in 10 years, writes •BACKGROUND: Many of the big names in SA wine were started by women: Steenberg, Muratie and now Altydgedacht - a 413ha spread granted to Elsje van Suurwaarde, wife of the deputy to governor Simon van der Stel in the closing act of the 17th century. The farm was put in Elsje\\'s name as employees of the Dutch East India Company were prohibited from owning land - something Van der Stel\\'s son, Willem Adriaan, found out when he was fired for setting up Vergelegen. Today the farm is run by John and Ollo, sons of octogenarian Jean Parker, an art teacher from the Eastern Cape, who has supplied grapes to Nederburg for over six decades. Etienne Louw makes the wine. •ARTISTIC MERIT: The old joke is that if you want to see how wine was made in the Cape 50 years ago, visit Altydgedacht in 10 years. Not much has changed since Elsje\\'s day. Summer is the best season to visit the rustic tasting room as the coal stove belches smoke in winter. The 17th-century winery built from clay bricks is one of the last surviving original cellars in the Cape. •UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION: Renosterveld is the name given to pockets of indigenous fynbos that have retreated to the crowns of hills in the Peninsula, driven upwards by farming pressures. On special occasions, such as the Seasons of Sauvignon Festival, or by prior arrangement, the Parkers organise botanical field trips in a Unimog. •DID YOU KNOW? While Napoleon was in exile on St Helena, his secretary, Emmanuel, camped at Altydgedacht, until he was deported by the British for trying to organise an escape for the emperor. •BEST WINE: US magazine Wine Spectator hailed the George Spies 1966 cabernet as \"the one true classic wine ever produced in South Africa\" and rated it an unprecedented 95 points out of 100. The wine was actually made by Jean Parker and her neighbour Phil Walker, from grapes grown on his Morgenster farm. George Spies was a Monis wine buyer who bought wine from Altydgedacht in the 1960s. Today the farm\\'s forte is pinotage, with a berth in this year\\'s Absa top 10 pinotage list plus one of five finalists in the inaugural Perold Absa Cape Blend Competition. But Michael Back of Backsberg fame has planted 4ha of pinot noir on a south-facing slope and the heartbreak grape of Burgundy should soon be shooting out the wine-show lights. In the white department, Altydgedacht sauvignon blanc is always a safe bet and the 2011 vintage has delicate nuances of ruby grapefruit that work with grilled yellowtail. •FOOD: Eat@Altydgedacht is a rustic restaurant, open for breakfast and lunch, Monday to Saturday from 9am till 3pm.

      "Club-hopping prof back on his travels NOMADIC coach \"Professor\" Mlungisi Ngubane, who has been to as many clubs as a golfer has in his bag, has dumped fifth-placed First Division club Chippa United for last-placed Atlie FC. We know he\\'s made a name as a renowned relegation-beater, but, Prof, isn\\'t this taking things a little too far? THE recycling of tired and washed-up soccer administrators continues unabated, with former SABC group executive Mvuzo Mbebe appointed CEO of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations Organising Committee. The overfed Mbebe does not inspire confidence and we\\'re wondering what vision and leadership he will bring to the organising committee. KAIZER Chiefs striker Lehlohonolo Majoro was hauled over the coals for flashing his vest with the slogan \"I do have balz\" after he scored against Moroka Swallows. For his actions he\\'s had his balls chopped off and been hit with a R10 000 fine. \"ARE you guys hungry?\" PSL media manager Altaaf \"Send Button\" Kazi this week asked the question-shy press at a Nedbank Cup press conference where snacks are traditionally served afterwards. Quite witty, Mr Kazi, quite witty - even Tsamaya was impressed. BLACK Leopards coach Vladislav Heric is having one hell of a week. His club said he didn\\'t travel to Zimbabwe for their African Confederations Cup because of visa problems and that he was also involved in a mix-up that saw him miss the flight to Durban for their league match against Golden Arrows. Heric\\'s absence has sparked rumours that he has been sacked by the club\\'s trigger-happy bosses. But a Leopards official insisted: \"He is still 100% our coach and what happened was just unfortunate.\" Tsamaya wants to remind fans that this is the same club that fired a coach after a single game in charge. POWERLINES, poor Powerlines - we can\\'t forget you lads this week, unfortunately. At the risk of adding insult to injury, we have to ask: WTF!? We hear poor goalkeeper Thabang Louw has been complaining of back pain after having to pick up the ball from his own net so many times in the 24-0 mauling by Sundowns. He is due for a spinal cord operation as soon as the power returns to the local lines. SA prodigal son Benni McCarthy was in the news this week, with fans calling on him to help resolve Bafana\\'s scoring crisis. \"You don\\'t want to be having old throngs hanging around the national team. You don\\'t want players like myself, Bhele [Siyabonga Nomvethe], [Macbeth] Sibaya and Sibusiso Zuma. We\\'re past it now,\" said McCarthy last year.

      "In the Withaak\\'s shade Groot Marico on a Bosman weekend is awash with tales as captivating as a hookthorn tree, writes Here in Groot Marico, stories are a currency. Words tie the inhabitants together EGBERT van Bart\\'s eyes are bright with moer coffee. He\\'s been brewing a potent version of the stuff over smoky coals until it carries a kick not dissimilar to fellow local resident Jacques du Plessis\\'s citrus mampoer. Another cup inspires the appearance of an unlikely musical instrument, of which Egbert has a formidable supply. This one is fashioned from the neck of an ancient banjo. Within moments, he\\'s zithering away under the stars like an excited cicada, part of the soundtrack to 2012\\'s Bietjie Bosman festival, held in the bushveld town of Groot Marico. Twice a year, fans of the teacher, murderer and Oom Schalk Lourens raconteur Herman Charles Bosman gather here to celebrate the writer\\'s life and wit. Locals, from sculptors to philosophers - some sporting impressive quantities of facial hair and a penchant for kaftans - are interspersed with pharmacists and psychologists, actors and students. They\\'ve all come to absorb the Marico spirit: this place that \"is so heavy with atmosphere, so strangely and darkly impregnated with that stuff of life that bears the authentic stamp of South Africa\". Groot Marico itself is a fine example of what Bosman called a dorp, with its surface placidity, verging on somnolence. It\\'s two main streets masquerading as back alleys; an NG Kerk; well-frequented bottle stores; a mosque; one lone ATM; and a pub, all baking gently in a miasma of bushveld dust. To call a local, you can dial an ancient telephone exchange (014252) and speak to the operator. There is no real central point to the low-slung town, no stand-out monument or landmark aside from Die Oog, the source of the Marico River\\'s clear water. It\\'s the people and their stories that give the dorp its sense of place. Bosman again: In a dorp, \"people have got a lot of time in which to talk; a lot of time to stand and stare ... and indulge in the most virulent type of scandalmongering\" - which of course springs merely from the all-too-human \"taking of a sincere interest in life and people\". Like its neighbours, North West towns Zeerust and Swartruggens, Groot Marico is a social and business locus for surrounding farmers. Unlike them, it\\'s tolerant of arty, literary types. It boasts a fair-trade-minded craft shop and a glass studio. B& B owners talk of literature, healing and sustainability rather than thread counts and occupancy rates. The info centre is crammed with Bosman tomes. The town\\'s best restaurant has a hip, expansive red couch in the restroom. But there is nothing cultivated or twee about Groot Marico. There are daddy-long-legs on the ceilings and the locals look you in the eye when they speak. \"Yes, Groot Marico is different (to its neighbours),\" agrees Egbert van Bart, a Bosman Literary Society member and resident. \"They have too many loveless activities.\" Exploitation of the land has \"attracted bad spirits\"; from Brits to Jo\\'burg the landscape is devastated and destroyed, he explains. Because it hurts to see it, people stop looking. And without care and conscious attention, things whither further. Not just plants or the environment, but people. And stories. Right here in Groot Marico, stories are a currency. Words tie the inhabitants together. The weekend is just a teaser for the grand event in October, when I\\'m told you really need to be a \"serious Bosman fan\" to get the most out of the experience. Not that the Bietjie Bosman variant is blasé about its namesake. From breakfast with roosterbrood to the last jerepigo at night, the great man is quoted copiously and at length. But unlike in October, when hundreds of out-of-towners come to pay their respects, local Bosman Literary Society members are not outnumbered by visitors. This means members like Jolene Muir, who puts Bosman poems to music and whose voice raises goosebumps in the balmy night air, play a key part. And Santa van Bart, the unsung queen organiser of the Bosman event, who for years helped locals access essentials such as ID books, and whose office was shot at by hardcore right-wingers pre-1994. Bosman did not actually live in Groot Marico itself for the six months that inspired so many Oom Schalk Lourens tales - he taught near Zwingli, closer to the Dwarsberge and the Botswana border. The old Heimweeberg farm school has since succumbed to the elements, but the Bosman Lit Soc members have built an exact copy in Groot Marico. The \"living museum\" stands at the heart of the festival and contains items once owned by actor Patrick Mynhardt, who for years brought Oom Schalk Lourens to life in his one-man shows. The society itself began some decades ago, when the local branch of the dendrological society would go wandering the Dwarsberge \"to look at trees\", as founder Arno Faul puts it. \"We\\'d make a fire, braai some wors and read some Bosman stories.\" It was on top of a mountain at sunset that they first decided to try to save the old school and began fundraising - building the replica came later. And things grew from there. As one resident wryly commented: \"Groot Marico has two things going for it: mampoer and Bosman. And one is unmarketable. Promote mampoer and you\\'ll just get hordes of Philistines with big bellies hanging over their socks.\" The weekend passed in a blur that had nothing to do with mampoer. I sat in the schoolhouse, damp with heat, listening to Dr Salome Snyman describe comparing manuscripts and unearthing a Bosman sketch deep in the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Centre at the University of Texas. There were numerous Bosman stories, some recounted around the campfire, such as the bittersweet tale of Gerrit van Biljon, who plants a line of bluegums for his wife because nothing sounds quite like the wind through bluegum trees - but who is himself buried in the thorny shade of a withaak. There was poetry and drumming, readings from Cold Stone Jug, about Bosman\\'s time in jail after shooting his stepbrother; and a ferocious quiz littered with Bosman minutiae. Quizmasters Tim Sandham (half of a duo that has just released A Bosman Companion) and actor Angus Douglas wrinkled their noses in disapproval as Bosman newbies failed to identify \"the biggest liar in the Marico\" - Krisjan Lemmer, of course. In between all this, there was time to drive down rocky roads - the tarmac in Groot Marico runs out fast - to admire the Marico gossiping over stones. There was a welcome drink in a shady pub with groundscraper thrushes on the lawns and a chrome miner within; and a happy hour spent talking about buying property with a newish resident. She remembers a house with a hole in the bedroom floor, which her husband nearly disappeared into. The homeowner shrugged casually and said it was \"net \\'n gat van die boom wat ons afgesny het (just a hole from the tree we cut down)\". Many residents smugly recounted the same story: once the dust of Groot Marico settles on your feet, you\\'ll be back. It\\'s not just the dust, magical as it may be. It\\'s people like Santa, or Theo, a lit soc member who says he loves Bosman \"because I love crazy people. He was not in the norm in his time. And I support anyone with a mindset that veers away. That\\'s why I like you people too.\" - Ç Janine Stephen FESTIVAL SOUNDTRACK: Egbert van Bart zithering with sculptor Johann Moolman Pictures: JANINE STEPHEN LOCAL INDUSTRY: A coffee house, above; and below left, Anna Molifi making roosterbrood.

      "Strike the right nose The fragile myth of perfume lured Tammy Frazer away from a career as at banker. By Jasmine is a poem, a walk in a night garden THIS is a story of a girl who followed her nose and discovered her calling. Or, perhaps, who followed her calling and discovered her nose. Originally from Durban, Tammy Frazer moved to London for three years after school, then spent her 20s in Sydney working for an investment bank. While she was working on her Master\\'s thesis, on corporate and social investment, she realised two things: that she wanted to do something creative, and that she needed to come back to South Africa. Over \"lunch with two rocket scientists - literally\", Frazer talked about perfumes. \"I didn\\'t know anything about it. I went home, went online and discovered this world ... But most of it was ultra-commercialised, all about mass production. I wondered: what if it could be done in a traditional way. It fascinated me, using raw materials.\" At which point, Frazer says, she knew: \"This is what I have to do for the rest of my life. I wanted to work with farmers, work with design. Be an entrepreneur.\" And she announced that she was moving home - to be a perfumier. Four years later and Frazer works from a modest space on Bree Street, Cape Town, its shelves stacked with bottles containing essences from all over the world: flowers, barks, spices, oils and resins. Internationally her perfumes are sold in Harrods in London, at chic Paris boutique Colette on the Rue Saint-Honoré and at the Annindriya Perfume Lounge in Amsterdam. She has just launched her 10th \"chapter\" (each of her ready-to-wear fragrances are numbered chapters), and produces bespoke perfumes for individual clients. Frazer creates all her perfumes by hand, an art she had to learn on the job. She uses only natural and organic raw materials to construct her scents, each chapter representing a place, a journey, a concept. The ingredients - simple, pure distillations - are surprisingly complex when experienced: sea fennel smells like a sea monster emerging from the brine; jasmine grandiflora is a poem by Tagore, a walk in a night garden. Frazer admits she\\'s not a chemist, that she has to trust her nose. When she struggles to get a formula right, she calls on experts - in Switzerland, in Belgium - who offer advice. Where Frazer is fortunate is that her cosmetic chemistry network is pretty good, as far as they go: her grandfather created Oil of Olay, and her father worked for Swiss perfume house Givaudan. Frazer made her first chapter - a \"gourmand\" or food-inspired fragrance - using her sister as a test subject. The next came from a trip to Madagascar together with 15 Japanese botanists. Chapter 3 was Sydney (coffee and orange blossom). Chapter 4, Corsica (in which she used their version of fynbos - the Immortelle or everlasting flower). Chapter 5 was inspired by walks in a Swiss forest; Chapter 6 an homage to the history of the spice route. Chapter 7 is Frazer\\'s \"signature\" fragrance - white rose and tuberose (Sophie Dahl wears it). Chapter 8 was the first male fragrance (although both sexes wear it), an interpretation of the English countryside. Chapter 9 was inspired by a trip in the Pakistani desert ... Frazer\\'s latest fragrance has been, she says \"very hard\" to make. It\\'s about Namibia and one of her raw materials is a resin known as omumbiri, which has never been used outside of north-west Namibia. Himba people burn the resin with coal and mix it with butterfat and ochre to use as a traditional perfume. \"Naturals create a more voluptuous scent,\" says Frazer. \"It\\'s lovely how they change all the time, and how different it is on you, on me. Synthetic fragrances on the market - they want it the same from start to finish. They don\\'t want surprises at the end.\" There is no branding on Frazer\\'s bottles. \"It\\'s not for me. You\\'re buying for you.\" MAKES SCENTS: Tammy Frazer creates all her perfumes from natural ingredients\n",

Her cooking equipment in the field could not match her sophisticated lab equipment, but she brought the same precision and creativity to making a meal of Stuffed Bread Sticks (using a recipe from Justin Bonello Cooks ... For Friends) in a campsite in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, Botswana. The freshly baked twisted bread turned out to be too good to stuff with boerewors as we had planned, so instead we ate it with a mixture of salsa made by photographer Marianne Schwankhart (tomato, avocado, spring onion and green pepper) and pesto, with roasted butternut on the side. You\\'ll need: Several longish sticks Fillings of your choice For the basic bread dough you\\'ll need: 4ml sugar 10ml dried yeast 100ml warm water 400g flour 4ml salt 60g butter 2 eggs Sunflower oil Method: First activate the yeast. Mix the sugar, yeast and warm water together, then sprinkle a tablespoon of flour on the top and leave in warm spot for 10 minutes or until frothy. Sieve the flour into a bowl, add the salt and then, using clean fingertips, rub in the butter. \"Next, beat the eggs lightly with a fork and add the yeast mixture. Make an indentation in the flour, pour in the yeast-and-egg mixture and knead it well until you have a soft, pliable dough. Brush the dough with sunflower oil, place in a big bowl, cover in clingwrap or a damp tea towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 40 minutes or until it has doubled in size. Knead the dough one more time and you\\'re ready.\" Lynn then tore off fist-sized pieces of dough, flattening them into \"cord-like snake shapes\" with her fingers as the recipe instructed. She created spirals of the dough on greased sticks and cooked them over medium coals on the wood fire, until they slid off smoothly. Picture: MARIANNE SCHWANKHART\n",

But let\\'s rake over the coals again. It was Zuma himself who let Malema off the leash ahead of the Polokwane conference in 2007. Back then, Julius was doing the big guy a favour by barking loudly at his opponent, Thabo Mbeki. Intemperate language was used, songs were sung about machine guns ... ah, those were the days! Malema seems to have learnt too well at his master\\'s knee. This week, he turned the memorial service into a frothy attack on the ANC, which, he said, had become pigs feeding on their own people. Drumming up little votes DELIVERING the JS Moroka Lecture in North West this week, Zuma veered from his prepared speech to emphasise the point to the audience that Moroka, who was one of the ANC presidents of the 1940s, was father to 10 children. When members of the audience started laughing, obviously drawing the link with Zuma having more than 20 children, Zuma giggled and shot back: \"He had 10 children; he understood the need for vote.\" When he\\'s a lady HOGARTH sees that the IFP\\'s Mario Oriani-Ambrosini was in fine form in parliament this week. But, considering he was speaking during Women\\'s Month, he might have chosen his words more carefully. According to the text released, he began: \"Madam house chair, minister, let us try to have a serene and a man-to-man discussion on an issue on which the whole country is trying to have some sanity and pragmatism.\" Later on, he had another gender-bending moment, saying: \"... I do because our minister is a man who has brought a gift of intellect and has her heart in the right place.\" Flattering to deceive? Gavel bangs down PARLIAMENT\\'S chief financial officer, Leslie Mondo, was dismissed with immediate effect on Friday. Said a statement: \"Mr Mondo was charged with five counts of misconduct related to financial matters. He was found guilty on four of these.\" But, wait, there\\'s more: \"The disciplinary hearing involving the secretary to parliament, Mr Zingile Dingani, is not yet concluded.\" The hearings \"follow recommendations by the auditor-general, who was asked by parliament\\'s presiding officers to investigate a salary advance of R186000 received by Mr Dingani in December 2011 for the construction of a security wall at his residence\". Well, at least somebody is watching the watchdogs. What\\'s in a name?

The names should reflect attributes such as democracy, inclusiveness, growth and opportunities. Well, that\\'s easy then.

An unlikely champion HOGARTH had to choke back the tears when he read how KwaZulu-Natal death squad accused Johan Booysen described his overnight stay in police cells as \"degrading and unnecessary\". As accused number one on a list of policemen facing more than 100 charges, he could have shown a little more humility. Does he really think he can become a champion of the rights of the accused who are innocent until proven guilty? OINK, OINK: Julius Malema\n",

      "Mugabe fighting to stay put MDC up in arms as Zanu makes big changes to draft constitution Mugabe and his party fighting hard to stay in power and HARARE CORRESPONDENT PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe\\'s Zanu-PF has rewritten the draft constitution, restoring as well as increasing unlimited executive presidential powers, in a move clearly aimed at preserving the status quo favourable to its octogenarian leader. This comes as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) facilitator in Zimbabwe\\'s political dialogue to restore a legitimate government and democracy, South African PresidentJacob Zuma,is expected back in Harare soon to mediate in a fresh dispute over the draft between Mugabe and other principals in the coalition government. Zuma\\'s international advisor, Lindiwe Zulu, confirmed this week that her boss could be heading to Zimbabwe - for the second time in as many weeks - to tackle the impasse over the new constitution. A perusal of the Zanu-PF draft, a copy of which The Sunday Times has in its possession, shows that Mugabe\\'s party has also removed devolution of power entirely and deleted all references to it. The devolution of power resonates with the marginalised provinces of the Ndebele-speaking provinces of Matabeleland, which largely abandoned Zanu-PF in 2000 after the advent of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). During the constitution-making outreach exercise, residents of Matabeleland demanded devolution of power, which was captured in the Copac draft, but critics say it is surprising that Zanu-PF was going against the views of the people. Zanu-PF spin-doctors argue that the people did not demand devolution of power but decentralisation of services. The party has also removed the peace and reconciliation commission; making all indigenous languages official; the open, transparent and public interview process for the appointment of judges has been replaced with a presidential appointment system. It has introduced mandatory national youth service, something flatly rejected by Zimbabweans during the out-reach programmes. Zanu-PF has also done away with a separate Constitutional Court and decided to let the status quo remain - the Supreme Court doubles up as a Constitutional Court. Dual citizenship has been banned for those who are Zimbabwean citizens by descent or registration, and Zanu-PF has mutilated the Bill of Rights by deleting all references to democratic society. In the Zanu-PF draft, agricultural land has been redefined to include any land used for poultry, so that they would be able to take any buildings used to rear chickens. They have also taken out the presidential running mate provisions and replaced them with the current system, with the new provision that in the event of the office becoming vacant the replacement will be chosen by the president\\'s party. The party has reposed all executive authority in the president by deleting the provision, which vested it in the president and cabinet, and reconstituted the imperial presidency by restoring virtually all the current presidential powers. It has also restored the current presidential immunity provisions and the presidential power to declare war without any restraint. Zanu-PF also wants to re-introduce the unfettered powers of the president to dissolve parliament. The party has taken out the provisions requiring a law to regulate Mugabe\\'s dreaded spy agency, the Central Intelligence Organisation, and requiring the CIO to be non- partisan and professional. It has reintroduced the public protector, an office Zimbabweans found useless and unhelpful during the outreach. Both factions of the MDC have roundly rejected Zanu-PF\\'s amended draft, with Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and Welshman Ncube dismissing it as unacceptable and an insult to Zimbabweans. \"I have studied the amendments Zanu-PF has made to the draft and I am astonished at the sheer scale of disrespect, contempt, insult and audacity exhibited by the amendments,\" charged Ncube. \"In many respects, their amendments make the draft worse than the current constitution, so that we would be better off with the current constitution. Even at our most foolish, there is no way we could ever accept those amendments. \"Anyone who does so would be committing political suicide. In fact, the draft is not just an insult to us but is also a mockery of the people who took time to make representations to Copac.\" Ncube said it was clear that the Zanu-PF hawks were itching for an early election. \"And this move they have made has brought them very close to their wish to burn down the country by having a rerun of the 2008 elections,\" he said. He added that it was his belief that the moderate elements in Zanu-PF have allowed the party to tinker with the Copac draft in the \"mistaken belief that the MDC formations are so fearful of an election without reforms that we would accept not only to be insulted but also a constitution which is the worst we could possibly have\". \"It\\'s not going to happen. It\\'s time to let the dice roll the way it will. If an election without a new constitution is the only way to move forward, then let it be. On our part we are not going to betray the people\\'s struggle for a democratic constitution. We will not yield an inch. We will provide the leadership required for the people to take up the struggle at the elections. The battle lines are truly drawn,\" he said. The haggling over the draft constitution is likely to incense Zuma. At the SADC summit in Mozambique last week, regional leaders urged the Global Political Agreement principals to expedite the process by dealing with the contentious issues in the draft. After surviving initial attempts to bar him standing for re-election in the watershed elections next year through term and age limits, Mugabe has been battling to change the draft, which his Zanu-PF loyalists say will reduce him to a \"mere administrative clerk\". The Zanu-PF politburo, which was expected to meet this Wednesday, held a special session yesterday to discuss the situation, before Mugabe left for the Non-Aligned Movement meeting in Iran. Senior politburo members tried to blackmail the MDC parties, saying if they continued to reject Mugabe\\'s amendments then polls would be held under the current flawed constitution. \"If Zanu-PF is pushed into a corner, then we may consider holding elections under the present constitution,\" Zanu-PF spokesman Rugare Gumbo warned on Friday. However, Tsvangirai and Ncube rejected Mugabe\\'s proposed amendments, prompting a stalemate. Ncube said his party had already written to Zuma, new SADC chairman Mozambican President Armando Guebuza, and troika chairman Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, asking them to intervene. Kikwete and other SADC leaders hauled Mugabe over the coals in Maputo, over his attempt to impose Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara on their facilitation process. SADC leaders have now frozen Mutambara out of the process. In his report to the SADC troika meeting in Maputo, Zuma said there were suggestions to put both drafts to the vote. \"MDC-T and MDC-N are of the view that the only way forward, if there are substantial issues for renegotiation on the part of Zanu-PF, is that the current draft be put to a straight \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' referendum, or that the current draft and a Zanu-PF draft be put to a referendum,\" says Zuma\\'s report, seen by the Sunday Times. \"Alternatively the referendum includes not only a \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' vote on the constitution as a whole, but also a \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' vote on each of the clauses of the constitution with regards to which Zanu-PF has an alternative formulation.\"\n",

The master of the braai will win R500000 cash and a new Renault 4x4 SUV. \"We have turned braaiing on its head,\" says Bonello. \"When you put 15 totally different people together, who do different things on the braai from anyone else, everyone\\'s braai universe suddenly gets much bigger. Throw fine dining into that and it really was a great experience.\" Chefs Bertus Basson and Marthinus Ferreira judge the braaied food created by the teams of two each week. They include a burly West Rand tattoo artist and his girlfriend, several hippies from Cape Town, Gautengers from both sides of the boerewors curtain, a rugby coach from Durban and Soweto sisters who discovered mussels for the first time in their lives. •See Lifestyle Magazine HELLO COOKS: Host Justin Bonello, centre, with judges Marthinus Ferreira, left, and Bertus Basson\n",

      "Let it ride It lies deep in the heart of battlefield country, but Spioenkop nature reserve in KwaZulu-Natal is as peaceful as it gets, writes HE was deep brown with furry flanks and neat hooves and boasted a name that sounded suspiciously like Rasputin. I hadn\\'t been on a horse in decades, but no matter. We went striding into the depths of Ezemvelo KZN\\'s Spioenkop nature reserve in the footsteps of guide Christopher Mazibuko, who seemed born in the saddle and could steer his own steed using voice and body language as much as pesky reins. For the next two hours we ambled around the grassy park that is Spioenkop, coming uncannily close to herds of zebra - \"pyjamas\", says Mazibuko - blesbok, and skittish red hartebeest. We, or rather Rasputin, clambered a rocky rise to survey a vulture hide, evidently little used. Blue wildebeest lurked in a thorny spinny; eland watched us impassively. A giraffe with its head in the clouds passed so close I was treated to an eye-level view of its dusty knees. And on the way back, my horse caught the scent of home in his nostrils and took off like a hot contender for the Durban July, depositing me back at the stables adrenalin-filled and happy. It was school holidays and a weekend, so I\\'m amazed that there wasn\\'t a whole posse of riders taking advantage of the crisp winter sunshine and the affordable rates. For some reason it was just Mazibuko and me, and I felt like a spoilt landowner surveying my farm in Africa. There was more action down by the lake. Here, a few vehicles jostled each other on the banks, while a boat traced lazy curves on the water. People were picnicking and emptying beer cans and doing their best to remove fish from the depths. But these were day visitors, and the campsites were more empty than uncrowded. The rest of the place was pure peace. The reserve consists of a skinny squiggle of land around a dam of the same name, with distant Drakensberg views. Some 4700ha support a surprising quantity of game, acacias and aloes. Giraffe crossed mini-Serengeti-like vistas and over 290 bird species have been recorded, including a plethora of cuckoos and the diminutive cuckoo finch. Later, already stiffening up from the bout in the saddle, I entered the reserve\\'s northern gate and headed for iPhika, a tiny tented camp tucked away on the bushy flanks of Spioenkop. The reserve\\'s lovely curves were bathed in late afternoon sunlight and rhino beetled away from the road as I drove by. Massive pancake footprints littered the raked dust paths as I lugged my gear to a tent - the camp is unfenced, although a steep drop down to a watering hole on one side means nothing is likely to take you by surprise as you gossip around the fire. Anything else you should be able to see coming down the path. I spent an undisturbed evening grilling dinner over the coals and only woke much later to a heavy tread - eland on the hoof. It would have been great to have spent another day ambling down the walking trail in search of bald ibis and the Iron Age cattle pens tantalisingly described in a reserve booklet. Other traces of earlier peoples remain too, like hut floors, grinding stones, stone tools and pottery shards. But there was only time for a quick dawn game drive. As I headed towards the lake, an entire family of rhino came bulldozing down the track ahead of me and sent me on my way, content. - Ç Janine Stephen GAME RIDE: Visitors can ride through the bush on horseback SEE THE PATTERN: Roaming Spioenkop on horseback allows the visitor to get up close to zebra and giraffe Pictures: JANINE STEPHEN\n",

      "Pallet factory enjoys growth The company employs 92 people, who have been equipped with training and skills THE history of Natal Box Factory demonstrates a valuable life-lesson that something positive and successful can be built from unexpected and often challenging circumstances. In the 1940s, Mr Hassim Suleman, a taxi driver, acquired Natal Wood & Coal in Jacobs, from a family member and continued supplying wood and coal to local households for heating and cooking at 25c a bag. Sawing old timber manually and making banana boxes with his start-up toolbox of hammers and nails, he soon established a reputation for quality products and reliability and competitive pricing. The first premises was expropriated to build a freeway south of Durban, and the second factory site was bought in the 1960s by the Durban City Council to develop the present Clairwood Market. Funds from this unexpected setback enabled Mr Suleman to build the current factory in Isipingo Rail, with easy access to transport routes, warehousing and distribution centres. From here, the family has continued to grow the business from its humble beginnings to an established brand. In 1987, while studying marketing and sales, Mr Mohamed Hassim Suleman (known as Fuad) joined his brothers, one who was a driver and the other in production, to market the business offering to corporate customers. His first order was for 150 pallets which took the three-man-team, five days to manufacture manually. The customer, Spar Natal, promised to increase the volume if the service and quality were acceptable. The next order was for 300 units, and this client has remained loyal to Natal Box Factory for more than 25 years. The product range increased to include shelving, decking, bed bases, doors and frames when the company purchased its first pneumatic tools. The specialist machinery has been upgraded and the factory now produces 2 000 pallets per day to regular customers including Natal Portland Cement, Plascon, the Willowton Group and Nampak (Bevcan) Corruseal Group. The company now employs 92 people who have been equipped with training and skills to make them productive members of the community. The team is committed to maintaining their quality and service levels and Mr Suleman believes that operating at 90% of capacity ensures that standards are maintained and customers retained. A future plan is to make use of factory waste (sawdust and timber off-cuts), manufacturing a profitable board product and recycling this material. Two years ago Mr Suleman established a separate complementary company manufacturing pallet/shrink wrap known as Cervante Industrial Supplies. This was a strategic move as it is directly related to the packing industry.\n",

      "FOOD ON TV HOOVES AND ALL watches teams turn the other beef cheek in a nose-to-tail challenge The five teams left in the Ultimate Braai Master competition are in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands this week, getting a taste of restaurant-style pressure. While stress isn\\'t usually part of the braai process, making pub grub on the coals can be as tough a test as, say, cooking while a really hungry family waits for their dinner. The twist here is that the contestants must use a combination of the \"good and the ugly\" bits of beef - such as testicles and rump or sweetbreads (glands) and sirloin. Also, they are warned by the judges that customers will be paying for their meals, and \"If you send us rubbish tonight, we\\'ll stop your service immediately and have no more food from you. Simple as that.\" The odd cuts do not really faze the contestants - though the gargantuan testicles have some in stitches and raise a few questions about the show\\'s PG rating. But the chef-judges insist innards are part of the tip-to-tail sustainable butchery process and have the potential to be \"special and delicious\\'. \"The food is not the problem, it\\'s all the yelling in the background,\" one contestant complains. But it is a showcase of innovative dishes that include tongue pie, battered testicles and crumbed sweetbreads, which all go down really well. ........................................ Ultimate Braai Master is on SABC3 on Thursday at 8pm. MARTHINUS FERREIRA\\'S BRAISED BEEF CHEEKS Serves 6 Ingredients: 500g beef cheeks, cleaned (ask a butcher for these) Salt and pepper 30ml (2 tbsp) olive oil 2 onions, finely chopped 2 carrots, finely chopped 2 sticks celery, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, crushed 1 litre beef stock 1 litre red wine 200g (1 punnet) button or shimeji mushrooms 10 baby onions, peeled 150g butter Handful chopped fresh parsley 15 baby carrots, keep tops on Method: Season beef with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large pan and fry beef till golden brown. Remove from pan and set aside. In the same pan, fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic till soft. Return the beef to the pan and add the stock and wine. Simmer on low heat for 5 hours or until very soft. Add the mushrooms and baby onions and cook uncovered until the sauce has reduced to a thick consistency. Check seasoning and stir in the butter and parsley. Blanch the baby carrots in rapidly boiling, salted water for 4 minutes. Serve the beef with mash and baby carrots. LOW STEAKS: Sindi Manthata from Team Gal Power making rib-eye WESLEY POON\n",

      "Shhh, there\\'s a school on my stoep Grade 10 pupil is \\'Miss\\' to disadvantaged kids \\'I give them a lot of love\\' BIÉNNE HUISMAN TEENAGER Magdaline Lewis\\'s classroom is a concrete porch where her \"pupils\" sit on steps and overturned buckets as mongrel puppies sleep at their feet. The 17-year-old, herself a Grade 10 pupil at Dysselsdorp Secondary School, is living her dream of becoming a teacher and has taken it upon herself to help educate the children of a poverty-stricken farming community in the Little Karoo. Since 2008, she has given extra-curricular \"school classes\" in the back yard of her parents\\' two-bedroom home in Kleinhans Street in Dysselsdorp, 20km outside Oudtshoorn in the Western Cape. Her alfresco classroom is flanked by roses and a vegetable garden with carrots, green beans and a large fig tree. And the side of an old, white washing machine doubles as a blackboard. Her 17 pupils, aged five to 15, have earned reputations for academic excellence, while their singing ensemble is the toast of the township. Her daily home-schooling programme kicks off with Bible study at 3pm. This is followed by mathematics and spelling lessons, choir practice and sports activities after 5pm - from Monday to Friday. She takes the class register every day, and absent pupils are duly noted and later hauled over the coals. She is not averse to disciplining her pupils and is known to dish out a light smack to those who misbehave. \"Sometimes I smack them when they get noisy and out of hand. It is important to teach them manners. I also teach them many other things, mostly practising what they learn at school. I give them a lot of love,\" she said between lessons. And she admits: \"Yes, I want to be a teacher one day - so badly.\" Estrolita Matroos, 11, one of her pupils, said: \"Juffrou is very friendly and caring towards all the children in the class. She gives us so much. She is also very beautiful. \"In the classes, we take turns to read from the Bible. She teaches the boys to kick a ball, and we jump with a skipping rope and practise athletics here in the street.\" Magdaline\\'s parents, Karel, 51, an unemployed builder, and Miekie, 52, a former domestic worker, and sister Anneen, 22, looked on during the interview. No one in the family has formal teaching experience. Miekie said the class moved into their bedroom when it rained. \"They sit on the bed. I\\'m only too grateful, as this keeps our daughter and the other children out of harm\\'s way,\" she said. \"We\\'re very proud of Magdaline, and her pupils are doing so well, passing their grades and getting diplomas.\" Karel is desperate to find work and was stung by bees this week while collecting honey for spare cash. Dysselsdorp Secondary School principal Mercia Moses said the socio-economic circumstances of her 996 pupils and their families were dire. Most parents, she said, were unemployed or travelled far to find work. Some worked in the kitchens of Oudts-hoorn restaurants, at ostrich feather factories or on vegetable farms. For most cash-strapped residents, the R30 return taxi fare to Oudtshoorn is considered steep. \"We call Dysselsdorp a \\'grant town\\' because the parents here live off grants. Unemployment is high. The children come from broken homes,\" said Moses, adding that Magdaline was addressing a pressing need in helping others. Magdaline\\'s Grade 10A class teacher, Deidre Jantjies, said: \"Three-quarters of my children live with their grandparents. This makes homework a huge problem, as the grandparents are often illiterate and cannot help them.\" She said Magdaline had a great \"lust for life\" and was a good team worker. Fellow teacher Stefanus Marnewick, who discovered Magdaline teaching three years ago, said: \"She has a very beautiful personality, and I find it wonderful how she treats the children. She is strict with them.\" Marnewick heads the school\\'s iSchoolAfrica press team, who made a video clip that brought Magdaline and her backyard classroom to wider attention after they uploaded it on YouTube. The national Department of Rural Development donated stationery to Magdaline after viewing the video. Despite abject poverty, the township of Dysselsdorp is experiencing a baby boom. Said Marnewick: \"You see, there\\'s not a lot to do here in Dysselsdorp - and that is the problem.\" Watch Magdaline in action at www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW8K8c3wqAA SILENCE IN CLASS!

      "Accidental Tourist Our guru\\'s spiritual journey In the great hitchhike of life, there are no free rides He asked if my kissing friend could sleep in his kombi HITCHHIKING is not a safe form of transport, but there was a time when that didn\\'t matter. What mattered was distance, and travelling into it. Destination was a vague concern that would never interrupt the accumulation of substantial distance. Which is how I came to be slouched against a tree on the N2 outside PE; myself, my backpack, and a kissing friend called Sarah. We were on the road to somewhere, but nowhere was fine too. Just when we thought we were finally getting nowhere, a beat-up VW kombi pulled up. It was bright orange, with two surfboards on top; the elbow leaning out the window was as tanned as a piece of saddle-back leather. When it drew level, the driver seemed to look down at us from the summit of a wise and compassionate civilisation. \"Sorry I\\'m late,\" he smiled. Or words to that effect. He was old, 26 or thereabouts, and already a great distance showed in the smile lines escaping from his sunglasses. His name was Shaun or Brian or David, but he preferred his spiritual name - Daityari or suchlike - which we battled to pronounce. Behind his back, we just called him guru. Surprisingly, he had short hair, except for a single-strand ponytail that looked vaguely kung-fu. His clothes were loose-fitting cotton. A three-day stubble clung to his jaw like an outbreak of spare time. He said he drew his inspiration from the east and laughed when we said we had just come from there - he meant the Far East, not the Transkei. According to him, our meeting was no coincidence. No, the universe revealed itself in mysterious ways and it was our job to make sense of it while having as much fun as possible. This is why he was on his way to Jeffrey\\'s Bay. From the beach, we watched him paddle out to the horizon, to sit there a while before sliding back in. That first night, he opened our minds with stories so wild that it seemed a miracle he was still alive. Or was he? He seemed unnaturally talented: he juggled red-hot coals like they were cold dumplings and knocked over an empty Liquifruit carton from 50m - with a Frisbee. When I struggled to pitch my tent in the wind, he did it in two minutes. He was so clearly superior that it seemed nice of him to ask if I would mind if my kissing friend slept with him in the kombi, rather than in my tent. That wasn\\'t necessary. I had presumed she would be sleeping with him, no matter that she was Catholic and unlikely to pleasure him in the manner to which he was surely accustomed. But such were his charms that the two of them soon disappeared behind the firm kaa-chunk of the kombi door, and if I was jealous it was because he hadn\\'t invited me too. The next day, we drove to Nature\\'s Valley and hiked into the forest. There, guru spoke sternly about human nature: we were spiritual beings, but would remain trapped in the material universe so long as we remained blinded by conformity and morality. From this, I surmised he hadn\\'t had his way in the kombi with Sarah - and sure enough she was back in my tent that night. When we reached Knysna, we learnt why guru didn\\'t like the material world: he was broke. At the petrol station he said the kombi would go no further unless we paid. He understood that we were hitch-hiking, but, in the greater scheme of things, so was he. Our guru was surprisingly fond of material compensation. When we returned from the bank, he was unimpressed: \"What\\'s with these R20s? You should be drawing R50s and R100s.\" At first I thought it was some kind of spiritual metaphor. Things turned a little sour towards the end. Our soundtrack of Indian sitar music had started to work on my nerves even before the cassette tape faltered. Nobody was smiling anymore. Then, standing on top of the Hangklip sand dunes, he announced our journey together was almost over. I don\\'t think it was coincidence that our last few cents bought just enough petrol to get home. To me the lesson was clear: in the great hitchhike of life, we may lose some money now and then, and maybe a kissing friend or two; what really matters is that we go the distance.

      "Koos Polony keeps them coming back NAMAQUALAND may be famous for its diamonds and flowers, but the main attraction in Kleinzee is a meat magician called Oom Koos Polony. Named after his signature product - a polony factory he once owned in Cape Town - Koos Coetzee has succeeded against all odds with his restaurant at the Kleinzee Golf Club. His steaks and droëwors are famous from Pofadder to Pretoria. Fans include diplomats and the top brass of diamond-mining company De Beers. Despite the near extinction of the town, whose population has dropped to fewer than 500 people, Coetzee still does a roaring trade from the golf club kitchen where he and his wife, Anna, set up shop six years ago. Koos & Anna se Kombuis was started after Coetzee was retrenched from the local Kwikspar, where he had run the butchery. \"I was asked if I was interested in making food for people here at the golf club. I said yes,\" he said. \"Nobody has ever complained about my steaks.\" His secret is cooking on hot coals and using quality meat from Kimberley. \"I once had the De Beers general manager eating here for a month.

In Braai: Reuben on Fire (Quivertree Publications, R380), the Franschhoek culinary hero concentrates on the coals, with a few surprises. Of his \"bugger-the-bun\" burger, Riffel says: \"When it comes to burgers, I don\\'t always like bread with them. I thought I\\'d rope in that mighty vegetable - the aubergine. It is very light and you can flavour it with that unique smoky braai essence. If you\\'re the muscle-bound type with an aversion to carbs or have a girlfriend who has nightmares about bread, then this is an excellent low-carb option that sacrifices nothing on the flavour front.\" Moving on to his lamb shanks with pesto, Riffel says: \"Our love for lamb borders on obsession. I reckon that because our Karoo lamb has that specific flavour from eating wild mint and dry rosemary-like bushes, we have the best-tasting lamb in the world. Don\\'t overcomplicate the ingredients. While at first the straightforward approach of doing simple lamb shanks with a nice pesto wouldn\\'t have occurred to me, I have realised the beauty of the food chain and come to appreciate why established combinations work. \"Rich lamb goes very well with something fresh and herbal so when braaied and served with a green sauce, it\\'s the perfect marriage.\" RED HOT Jan Scannell started the National Braai Day initiative in 2005 and as Jan Braai is a beloved TV cook. Red Hot (Bookstorm/Pan Macmillan, R275) is as entertaining as his previous book, Fireworks, and contains even more inventive recipes for heritage food. Of the two recipes overleaf, Jan Braai says: \"Ostrich meat is quite South African. It\\'s also quite healthy. While we\\'re on the healthy route, I suggest serving ostrich fillet in the form of a salad. As with beef steak, you braai ostrich fillet over very hot coals. Let it rest properly before slicing it into thin slivers. The idea here is not that you have to serve the meat while it is still hot from the fire. The idea is that you serve meat that has a great flavour from the fact that it was braaied. \"The Gatsby sandwich is a cult classic in the Western Cape. Our choice of meat for the braai Gatsby is masala-spiced steak. I advise you to whack the steak a few times with a meat mallet if you think it\\'s going to be tough. This is general advice not only applicable to this recipe. If you think your steak is going to be tough, slap it in the face a few times until it drops that attitude.\" VELD TO FORK Not strictly a braai book, Veld to Fork, by Gordon Wright (Struik Lifestyle, R250) brings a gentler time and place to life in every landscape photograph and every plate of comforting Karoo food. This Graaff-Reinet chef combines tradition with modern flair in 82 dishes, beautifully photographed by Sean Calitz. A book to keep for generations. Of his lemon and thyme chicken burgers, Wright says: \"These are great for a healthy, wholesome lunch or supper. When the kids feel like fast food, give them these. You can cheat by buying chicken mince or breasts from your butcher to save time. Just using breast meat can leave the patties a little dry so I use a mixture of all the chicken cuts to ensure a succulent, juicy patty. Experiment and see what works best for you.\" -\n",

Because if they don\\'t win, they get pissed off. That\\'s a good thing and it\\'s also not a good thing TONGS will wag at the Heritage Day Braai-B-Que contest at the Johannesburg Good Food & Wine Show on Tuesday. Thirteen of South Africa\\'s deftest fire jockeys will grill off for places in a historic braaivleis invasion of the US. Six of the contenders will be chosen to join two celebrated Gauteng braaiologists - Braaiboy (Gareth Daniell) and Borries (Corné Bornman) - in a team that will fly the flag in two international barbecue summits: the Jack Daniel\\'s World Barbeque Invitational in Lynchburg, Tennessee, and the World Food Championships in Las Vegas, Nevada. In between, the ous will scope out the Wild West. Team ChesaNyama Braai-B-Que will travel the 3000km between Lynchburg and Vegas in a camper van, leaving a trail of artisanal boerewors along Route 66. \"We\\'ll have a cameraman with us, so by the end we\\'ll release something a bit like the Blair Witch Project. Lots of shaky hand-held shots of firelighters,\" said Borrie. The team leaders are high priests of the cult of the coals. They have even registered a trademark for the Uniworsity of South Africa, a yet-to-be-formal-ised institution. Cigar-chomping Braaiboy, from Pretoria, is garrulous and slightly manic. In the past four and a half years he has braaied every day: that is about 4000 hours. The daily braai is his trademark. \"To keep my promise, sometimes I have to race home and light the fire at 11,\" said Braaiboy. \"Once I had to use a disposable braai inside a Sun City hotel room. It gets interesting sometimes.\" Braaiboy holds the Guinness World Record for continuous braaiing: an eye-watering 62 hours of tong action. He also plans to braai in space one day and at the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. On October 12 at Ridgeback\\'s in Pretoria, he will practise his art underwater. \"The cooking surface will be in an air bubble with a smoke outlet. We\\'ve tested it on a small scale and it works.\" Borries is a sardonic man-mountain, born, raised and based in Alberton. \"Once you\\'re in this place, they don\\'t let you out,\" he said. He runs a B& B called Borisimo\\'s, which is also home to the only Weber Smoky Mountain in the country - a contraption resembling a steam locomotive. It is essential to the team\\'s plan of beating the Americans at their own game, which is all about the laborious smoking of cuts of pork. \"We\\'re smoking something every week,\" said Borries. \"Brisket takes 12 to 18 hours and all the while you have to maintain the temperature without getting too much smoke flavour. And then you have to layer the flavours as well by wrapping the meat, which also helps with tenderising.\" But why copy the hosts? Surely the team should blitz those gringos with some sublime Mzansi flavours? \"We\\'ve been advised not to try that by some of the expats over there,\" said Borries. \"One former contestant from South Africa tried a peri-peri chicken once and came stone last. So he says don\\'t try to differentiate in the main competition.\" But they will get a chance to flash their boerewors in the local-style competition, in which they will challenge rivals from Poland, Russia, Estonia and Australia. \"The Americans might get a bit of a shock because we\\'re bringing our makarapas with built-in vuvuzelas. We have a call system worked out - one blast is \\'Here I am\\'. Two is \\'I need a beer, very quickly\\'. Three short ones is \\'I\\'m in trouble, come quickly\\'. I think we\\'re going to freak the Americans out a bit.\" The duo hope that in years to come the team will be joined by a South African entourage of hundreds along Route 66. \"The thing with South Africans is they\\'re against competing,\" said Borries. \"Because if they don\\'t win, they get pissed off. That\\'s a good thing and it\\'s also not a good thing. And that\\'s why we said listen, guys, please, we want to call ourselves the Brafia - a fraternity of guys who enjoy this culture. It\\'s a day out more than a competition.\" There will be no women in the team this year - not by design but by meritocratic selection, they argue. \"There were two girls that nearly made it, one from Brakpan and one from Bloem,\" said Braaiboy. \"They made it into the reserves for the finals. But, unfortunately, it\\'s only men.\" He does fret about why the skottel has become the protected territory of the South African male, with the tongs functioning as a sort of symbolic opposable phallus. \"It\\'s not that braaiing necessarily suits us more - it\\'s just that we\\'re the ones that do it the most, so we\\'ve got the most practice. But I\\'ve been to places in this country where the guy doesn\\'t braai. He can\\'t braai. It\\'s his wife that does it. \"But I can count the number of times that\\'s happened on one hand. It\\'s sort of fallen into our responsibility and it\\'s a social norm. And it doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t make a salad either. We can make one, but we don\\'t.\" And what of braai etiquette? \"The rule of thumb is don\\'t be an ass. If the beer isn\\'t cold, you can bitch and moan, but not about the brand. And if you\\'re at a guy\\'s house and he\\'s braaiing, don\\'t go and chip in and give comments.\" Borries is irked when someone tosses a stompie into his fire. But Braaiboy is less fundamentalist. \"If there are flames, then stompies are okay.

      "White privilege Does being white in South Africa 20 years after democracy still mean enjoying advantages not available to other races? Gillian Schutte, Steve Hofmeyr and Eusebius McKaiser give very different viewpoints on a subject that continues to spark heated debate Pale, male and blind Whites seem to get away with both explicit and implicit racism in our public sphere An entire nation of people had their aspirations and dreams and normalcy systemically removed WHAT is white privilege? A sense of anxiety pervades my body as I tackle this topic again, for I know the backlash will be huge. It always is. We, the so-called rainbow nation, remain blinded by whiteness in South Africa. This is most obviously evidenced in the social furores that erupt every few months in our public sphere. It is hard not to notice how these eruptions play out along similar lines every time. What is clear is that in every instance that black persons have made a supposedly racist public slur they are dragged across the media hot-coal pit, publicly shamed, sometimes even lose their jobs and generally take a beating. Yet white people seem to get away with both explicit and implicit racism in our public sphere - often. I have yet to see white persons losing their job over a public complaint about unfair discrimination against them, or for insulting a black person in their column. It seems that to lose your job as a white bigot you need to break the cardinal rule of polite non-racist discourse and say the K-word in public. The difference is that if black persons make a legitimate complaint about the historically based hierarchical racism experienced by black people, the majority of whom remain at the bottom of this economic social hierarchy, they are accused of racism. If a black leader sings a struggle song, which is historically rooted and speaks about killing the enemy, he is taken to the Equality Court and banned from singing it. Yet just this month we saw, in public, the Red October protesters carrying posters that spoke of killing a taxi-load of black people for every one white parent killed. Nothing has been done about this blatant display of racism and threat of violence against black people in the public sphere, and many who are blinded by whiteness have refused to take this seriously. The media never dragged the leaders of this movement over the coals and demanded to know how they can host social sites that speak of blackness in the most derogatory and dehumanising terms imaginable. These are the double standards of a white-privileged dominant discourse at work. It is all about who governs the public discourse, and the white-privileged class has made sure to hold on to the dominant narrative in this country. It is the domain of the chattering class and the corporate class, facilitated by the mainstream media. But this is the privileged class\\'s best-kept secret - in fact, it is so secret that even they are unaware that a discourse of white privilege dominates our public conversations and debates. It is only when exposed that all hell breaks loose. As someone who does this regularly, I have been accused of being a self-hating white person, a black wannabe, masochistic and worse. And I am not just talking about the lunatic fringe; I am talking about academics, opinionistas, gatekeepers and human rights activists too. I have been told I want whites to hand over all their hard-earned economic privileges to \"the blacks\" and \"then I will be happy\". But privilege is not simply about wealth, although many white people will argue that they \"deserve their privilege since they worked so hard for it\". The implication is that the majority of black people are poor because they do not have the same work ethic. This is a prime example of the non-reflexivity of the privileged white discourse. It contains within it implicit racist beliefs and suggestions about black people, effectively \"othering\" them, but it does not recognise this. Let us break this down. By assuming white wealth is all about hard work, the default would be that black poverty is all about laziness. This narrative is devoid of the understanding that, historically, the indigenous population were stripped of their land, forcibly removed from family and prevented from earning a decent livelihood because they were reduced to cheap labour. All chances of a decent life were taken away by a ruthless system that forced the black population to become virtual slaves to the tiny white population - to work on the mines and farms (land that once belonged to them) and in our houses and gardens. Schools were few and far between and the education was second grade. Food was scarce and children grew up malnourished. An entire nation of people had their aspirations and dreams and normalcy systemically removed as white people grew their exclusive economy on the sweat off the black population\\'s backs. This decimation took place over three centuries. How do white persons then have the temerity to say their wealth is because of their own hard work and not factor these historical realities into the equation? How does white privilege demand of blackness that they forgive and forget when the effects of this history are still very much with us today? There, again, white privilege kicks in and creates the narrative that it is all to do with the government of the day. Well, yes, the government of the day should have stuck to the Freedom Charter and gone with a socialist development plan so that the gap between rich and poor was lessened considerably. But it did not. Instead, it appeased white people with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and then adopted a macroeconomic policy that favoured white business, built a black middle class over two decades and enriched a small percentage of elite black businessmen. Not only that, but this system also allowed the government to become part of the elite. This, it seems, was a wily move on the part of white business because it has ensured the government is constantly in the \"corruption spotlight\", whereas the white corporate elite continue to live obscenely lavish lifestyles. They fall under the radar. They remain criticism-free. We are busy blaming the government for its greed and all the ills of society, including, it would seem, historical ills. The government must be criticised for falling into this trap and letting down the majority as it sups with the corporate class. But why should the corporate class get off scot-free as it continues to live opulently off the land\\'s resources and could not care less about the growing gap between rich and poor? The white privileged class is so sure of its moral high ground and superiority that it will continue to deride a government under which it has grown richer in the past two decades, as statistics have shown. This is indicative of collective white privilege at play in the dominant discourse. But dare talk about it or, worse, write about it and you will be metaphorically \"twittered and feathered\" and shamed for your observations. The misogynistic vitriol that you will be subject to is beyond the pale and mostly from furious pale males. Either this is because social gatekeeping is historically a male domain and how dare a mere woman take up space, or it is because you have simply said what these gatekeepers will not say. But mostly it is because we remain a nation that is blinded by whiteness, and therein lays the conundrum of the invisibility of white privilege in South Africa. Picture: RUVAN BOSHOFF\n",

      "AT THE SHISA NYAMA SUMMIT Chilleks Place wins first Nando\\'s Shisa Nyama Challenge Bahama Bar in KwaThema, Springs, sizzled with saucy braais and the sounds of hot music last weekend, when a popular Port Elizabeth joint took top spot in the first Nando\\'s Shisa Nyama Challenge. Competing against nine other shisa nyamas from across South Africa, Chilleks Place got the judges\\' nod for its flavourful peri peri sauce recipe. Ten numbered platters of meat were presented to the three judges: Hilary Biller, editor of Sunday Times Food Weekly, Llewy Mateza of The Local Grill and Mmatshipi Matebane of Nando\\'s South Africa. In a blind judging session, they scored the dishes according to taste, presentation and best use of Nando\\'s sauces. Chilleks won a R25 000 cash prize and the opportunity to host next year\\'s Shisa Nyama Challenge, with all expenses paid by Nando\\'s. The runners-up were two Gauteng-based shisa nyamas: Phillip\\'s Place in second place and Endaweni in third. Supported by Metro FM and Ikwekwezi FM, the inaugural Nando\\'s Shisa Nyama Challenge attracted hundreds of meat-loving families. DJs Ganyani, DJ Nutty and Fistaz Mixwell spun the latest dance tunes while children and their parents enjoyed riding the mechanical bull in the kiddies\\' play area. The next Nando\\'s Shisa Nyama Challenge will be held in 2014 at Chilleks Place in Port Elizabeth.

      "Thanks be to God for giving us such a superb gift He was an icon of forgiveness and reconciliation with unassailable moral stature, writes Had a lesser mortal been our president, perhaps we might not have made the transition so relatively peacefully and the TRC might not have happened - or it would have had an even rougher ride GOD must love South Africa especially to have given us so many wonderful people: Beyers Naudé, Bram Fischer, Helen Joseph, Lilian Ngoyi, Mangaliso Sobukwe, Steve Biko, Walter Sisulu, Yusuf Dadoo and many others. And then, to top it off, God gave us this truly remarkable man,Nelson Mandela,who became a legend in his lifetime. Without him we almost certainly would not have made the near-miraculous transition from repression to democracy so relatively peacefully. I metNelson Mandelafor the first time in the early \\'50s. He was adjudicating a debating contest between those of us from the Bantu Normal College (presumably for normal Bantu whose student residences were rondavels, no doubt to help us develop along our own lines!) and the Jan Hofmeyr School of Social Work. He probably was a good judge because our team won. My next encounter with him was in 1990 when he was released from Victor Verster Prison and came to spend his first night of freedom at Bishopscourt, the archbishop of Cape Town\\'s official residence, when I was the incumbent. The government had refused me permission to visit either Robben Island or the other maximum-security prisons. Mandela did write to me to thank me for whatever it was that I had, in his view, done for Winnie and the children. In 1988 I had addressed a huge crowd of about 250000 at Hyde Park Corner, London. Many had come as pilgrims from every quarter of the British Isles at the invitation of Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, then chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, to celebrate Madiba\\'s 70th birthday. Most of those present had not been born when he was sentenced to life imprisonment. They had not seen nor heard him speak and yet they came in their droves to celebrate what Archbishop Trevor declared must be Madiba\\'s last birthday in prison. Not bad, for two years later he was out of prison. On February 11 1990, the day Mandela was released, we saw little of him at Bishopscourt because he was closeted with his ANC colleagues - and frequently interrupted: \"There\\'s a call from the White House\" or \"State House in Lusaka\". Quite a few people were worried that his reputation while in jail had become that of a moral giant and that it would turn out that he had feet of clay. There were those who did not want him released lest we all suffer from a monumental letdown when it turned out that he was but a fallible mortal. We need not have worried. He was, like many of us, deeply distressed at the carnage that was happening in the black community - the so-called black-on-black violence. Many of us believed it was being fuelled by a sinister third force intent on scuppering the delicate negotiations for transition from repression to democracy. The situation was particularly desperate in the killing fields of KwaZulu-Natal and on the East Rand, in the horrendous bloodletting between the ANC and the IFP. Madiba was firmly convinced that F W de Klerk could have stopped the violence but was callously indifferent because black lives were of little value to him. His rare flashes of anger were reserved for De Klerk\\'s apparent indifference and led to the suspension of the Codesa talks after the Boipatong massacre. Madiba was ready to do virtually anything within reason to stop the internecine carnage. Then it happened that the Bishop of the Methodist Church, Dr Stanley Mogoba, and I convened the Kempton Park Summit between Madiba and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the IFP, who had announced that his party would boycott our first democratic elections. You did not need to be clairvoyant to predict that the intended boycott would almost certainly lead to a huge loss of life, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal. I was amazed at the concessions that Madiba was prepared to make. The IFP demanded that it be recognised as a legitimate liberation movement and not continue to be vilified as an ethnic Bantustan collaborator with the apartheid regime. Buthelezi wanted to address political rallies together with Madiba. Many in the ANC regarded that as anathema, as something that would give the IFP a credibility it did not deserve. And it would create the impression that the two leaders were equal in stature. The IFP also insisted on the right to carry so-called traditional weapons. Madiba gave in on all these points. He even went on to say that although he had not consulted his colleagues on this particular point, if the ANC won the election he would appoint Buthelezi to a very senior cabinet position such as minister of foreign affairs. All he was asking for in exchange was that the IFP agree on the proposed election date and to participate in it. The response was negative on both those points. That summit showed me the lengths to which Madiba was prepared to go to achieve a goal he considered important. It all paled in comparison with what he was to show the world as president. Many had expected that the advent of a black-led government would be the signal for an orgy of retribution and revenge. Instead, the world was awed by the spectacle of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where the victims of atrocities revealed a remarkable nobility of spirit and magnanimity in their willingness to forgive their former tormentors. We were richly blessed that Madiba was at the helm of our ship of state. He showed us the way by example and thus established his place in the world as an icon of forgiveness and reconciliation with unassailable moral stature. Who will ever be able to calculate what his various conciliatory gestures contributed to nation-building and unity? He invited his former white jailer, as a VIP guest, to attend his inauguration as president. He invited to lunch Percy Yutar, the prosecutor in the Rivonia Trial who had asked for the death sentence to be passed on Madiba and his comrades, and he visited Betsie Verwoerd, the widow of Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect and high priest of apartheid. In a gesture that would have been gauche from anyone else, he wore the Springbok jersey during the Rugby World Cup final in 1995. And when we beat the All Blacks, something that would have been unthinkable just a few years before took place: black South Africans celebrated the victory in the townships, victory in a sport that for so long had been identified with their arch-oppressor. Had a lesser mortal been our president, perhaps we might not have made the transition so relatively peacefully and the TRC might not have happened - or it would have had an even rougher ride than it actually experienced. This was a truly great man who believes fervently that a leader exists for the sake of the led. I had lunch with him once in Houghton and at the end he saw me to the door and called out \"driver\", meaning my driver. I said I had driven myself from Soweto. He said nothing. A few days later he rang me to say he had not consulted me but had been concerned that I was driving myself, so he had phoned one of his rich business friends who had agreed to send me a large monthly grant to pay for a driver. It was this passion that made him work tirelessly to raise funds for schools and clinics. It was second nature to him and so he kept up a punishing schedule. He believed so fervently that people really mattered that he stopped to shake hands with people, however lowly their station. For him they counted. The people warmed to his love for them and loved him in return. You just had to see the reception he received everywhere, the adulation and hero worship. He enjoyed it like a little child and seemed so surprised that people should react in this fashion. I could pick up the phone to raise whatever issue was causing me concern, especially with the TRC, and he would say, \"Come over for breakfast or lunch\" and we would sort it out. Maybe he liked me a bit - even when I criticised his lack of sartorial taste over those shirts and he retorted that I was hardly one to speak when I wore dresses in public. He asked me to be his envoy to try to persuade the Nigerian president, Sani Abacha, to release his political opponent, Moshood Abiola. I failed in my mission, although I was permitted to see Abiola under house arrest. When a TRC commissioner was being investigated by a judicial commission for alleged complicity in a gross offence, the subject of an amnesty application, Madiba wanted to put him out of the misery of waiting for the report. I told the president\\'s secretary that I was upset as I should be the first, as TRC chairman, to know the contents of the report. A few minutes later the president was on the line. \"Yes, Mpilo (my Xhosa name, which means \\'life\\'), you\\'re quite right. I\\'m sorry.\" Perhaps it is only the truly great who have the humility to say sorry. Most politicians avoid it like the plague. He loved Winnie deeply. They visited our Soweto house soon after his release to enjoy Xhosa cuisine and you could see how he followed her every movement with his eyes. He was hurting very much and told me some things that a man does not usually tell another man about his wife. It was a huge blow to him when the break happened. He admired her for all she had accomplished despite harassment from the state and for how she had single-handedly brought up their two daughters. It was wonderful when Graça came into his life. He blossomed and was like a teenager in love for the first time. Both of them deserved the joy they brought to each other. He was good; when I hauled him over the coals for \"shacking up\" with her and giving our youth a bad example, they promptly got married. They became a wonderful advert for love and marriage. At (now Minister of Justice) Jeff Radebe\\'s wedding, I caught Graça removing perhaps an imaginary piece of fluff from his shirt. When he was alone for a bit, I went over to him and said: \"Yu \\'ndoda lamfazi uyaku thanda he (I saw her dusting you off).\" He retorted excitedly: \"Did you see that?\" I was thrilled for them. What a magnificent gift. The best we can do is to emulate him and make a scintillating success of our land, caring especially for the most vulnerable and seeking to be as altruistic as he is. Thanks be to God for giving us such a superb gift, the father of our rainbow nation.

      "The cycles of life take a bike tour through Khayelitsha and the Cape Town city centre THE sizzle of grilling meat from Braai Mambongi almost derailed our cycling tour through Khayelitsha - Marianne and I had got going at dawn. But the metallic tang of a heap of smileys (sheep\\'s heads), staring up with a bloody grin next to cauldrons, was easier to resist. Khayelitsha resident Skeezo Vicani, in a purple top and red shoes, was our charismatic guide for two Bike & Saddle tours. Sightseeing on a bike is faster and can cover more ground than on foot. With Skeezo in pole position, Marianne and I bounced through the streets of the Bo-Kaap and Khayelitsha, switching road bikes for mountain bikes when we shuttled from the Cape Town city bowl to the Cape Flats. Our first stop in Khayelitsha was the Velokhaya Life Cycling Academy, which is worth a visit. This cycling club started in 1999 with only a few bikes and members. These days, it has its own BMX track and has trained elite riders who compete internationally. The academy serves as a base for rides, which include the Look Out Hill Tourism Centre, a braai marketplace and Khayelitsha\\'s backbone, Spine Road. Bike & Saddle tours is an \"eco-active\" company that organises a range of cycling, hiking and paddling trips. Most of the cyclists who join the trips are foreigners, Skeezo said. \"The tours give me an opportunity to meet people of different cultures. They also give people an opportunity to understand the culture of people in the townships.\" These tours are an easy way for South Africans to explore their cities and communities. \"Township tours\" took off in the late 1980s under the Institute for a Democratic Alternative in SA, at a time of apartheid segregation and repression. The first time I met a tour group while visiting friends in Nyanga, it was a novelty. When my friend Buyiswa Jack moved from Nyanga to Khayelitsha, I attended her son\\'s post-initiation celebration there and her husband\\'s funeral at the Lookout Hill Tourism Centre. But this bike tour to Lookout Hill was a cheerful occasion, coinciding with a traditional-dance competition. Skeezo led us on the short hop from the academy to Lookout, where we left our bikes in a foyer near the craft market. We walked up a battered boardwalk to the top of a dune, with a view over the settlement towards the Hottentots-Holland mountains and over False Bay. Lookout Hill is a Khayelitsha landmark at the crossroads of Mew Road and Spine Road. We pedalled along Spine Road, abuzz with enterprise from braai places to hair salons and spaza shops. In one block we passed Peter\\'s Hair, Grace Hair and Ernest Hair next to a \"Baber & Shoe Repair\" stall. The braai marketplace had more than 10 stalls with half drums of coals and stacks of meat and pap. The wooden tables and benches with Coke umbrellas were empty in the morning. From here we meandered through Section D, across a railway bridge, back to Velokhaya. \"Cycling is changing the lives of many young kids from the township,\" said Skeezo. The cycling club\\'s star is Luthando Kaka, who represented SA in the Youth Commonwealth Games, before joining a professional team in Denmark for two seasons. Now he is the captain of Bonitas Team, a professional road-cycling team based in Joburg. Skeezo, 36, likes speed but his true passion is guiding. The City Heritage tour he leads in the shadow of Table Mountain follows an historic route on steep roads. On that route, we pedalled along the Fan Walk, uphill to De Waterkant village and across to Long Street, then climbed the cobbled streets of the Bo-Kaap and freewheeled back to the V& A Waterfront, where we had begun. Skeezo recounted South Africa\\'s history while we passed the Cape Town Stadium and headed into the city. We stopped for coffee in Long Street but it started to drizzle, which meant we bypassed the Company Gardens, Parliament, the National Gallery and the Castle. But we did admire the traditional architecture and 10 mosques of the Bo-Kaap, where South Africa\\'s oldest mosque can be found. From this old quarter - now a popular photographic hub - we returned to the Waterfront, where Skeezo waved us farewell.

Five chefs featured in the book tell us how their thoughts and tastes have changed in 20 years of democratic cooking FIVE WOMEN, MANY FLAVOURS YVONNE SHORT Chef and Pick n Pay Food specialist South Africa has fantastic chefs, who use local, seasonal produce, care about the wellbeing of livestock, manage waste and the environment, support small businesses and of course local farmers and artisan suppliers. Their passion for food spans cultures and leads to friendships and connections based on mutual respect and appreciation (and celebration) of creative talent. For the past 20 years, I have been privileged to be part of this wonderful, exciting food adventure. The information age has contributed to the democratisation of cooking, so to speak. We are surrounded by cooking shows, websites, magazines and books that bring the wondrous world of food into our homes. Everyone with a TV and a designer apron can be a master chef. Our choice of ingredients is now endless. Twenty years ago we couldn\\'t buy Danish Viking Smoked Sea Salt or bamboo-roasted sea salt. Our wine cellars are now filled with luscious balsamic elixirs infused with truffles, figs, cherry and mango. We can choose the colour purple for carrots and the length of the stem for broccoli. Which makes dragging out and resurrecting old recipes and cooking methods even more exciting and fabulous. Twenty years ago I made this grilled goat\\'s cheese wrapped in banana leaves. It feels even more relevant today, as African flavours continue to inspire us. GRILLED GOAT\\'S MILK CHEESE IN BANANA LEAVES 2 banana leaves 200g goat\\'s milk cheese Pinch of lemon pepper Pinch of dried origanum Olive oil, for drizzling Wash leaves in hot water. Divide the cheese into two rounds and place each on a banana leaf. Season with pepper and origanum and drizzle with oil. Fold the leaf over, wrap tightly and tie with raffia. Grill or braai on medium coals until leaves are slightly charred. Open leaf and eat the cheese with grilled fruit, such as quince. Serves 2 SUZI HOLTZHAUSEN Chef owner of Gaaitjie restaurant in Paternoster, West Coast In the last 20 years I have gone from teaching to operating a restaurant. I guess it meant putting my money where my mouth was. Having moved from the African heartbeat of Gauteng to the West Coast nine years ago, my flavour use has mellowed. I use only touches of earthy spice. It is a special experience to cook for visitors to Paternoster. People who travel are adventurous, willing to try unfamiliar ingredients and flavour combinations, plus they are relaxed, which makes for the ideal customer. Being in a small country village forces you to use local, sustainable fresh produce. On the food trend scene, thankfully, the foam is finally off the plate and back in the sea! Twenty years ago I described South African cuisine as a \"tinned fruit salad - colourful but nothing standing out\". I have realised (and I still don\\'t know why) that each tin of fruit salad only ever contains one cherry. In South African cuisine, that \"cherry\" has become much more valued. We care about how and where our food is grown, whether it has a festival in its honour, how far it travelled to make it into the tin. We prefer it fresh and picked in season, we recreate how grandma used to prepare it, taking us to a place of comfort. We look into how it was first used, when it arrived in our history. We replant the stone and watch it grow. And we are starting to care what happens to the tin. Orzo (pasta rice) is still one of my favourite ingredients and a great stand-by.

Serves 4 CASS ABRAHAMS Food consultant and author of \\'The Culture and Cuisine of the Cape Malays\\' Traditional South African cuisine will always be my passion, but as a chef I have become very fond of experimenting with new, healthier dishes. I have also become interested in exploring food from the field, especially the greens the khoi-san used. I would very much like farmers to start growing these plants, as I think it will add a fantastic dimension to our cuisine. My audiences today have a far greater knowledge of food and are more open to trying new tastes and ingredients, maybe because of the great variety of cooking shows on TV and the abundance of new cookbooks. The number of men attending cookery classes has increased significantly. And as more young women become professionals, but still want to cook and eat food their mothers and grandmothers made, there has been increasing demand for classes that teach traditional home-cooked food. When I started introducing Cape Malay cuisine to a broader audience, I was dismayed at the lack of spice knowledge among the white population, who were severely disadvantaged by apartheid. Things as common as allspice and tamarind were completely foreign to them. That has changed and Malay cuisine, once regarded as exotic, has taken its rightful place in South African culture. I still make masala fish exactly the same way as I did 20 years ago. The only concession I have made is that if it is served in a restaurant, I recommend fish with very few bones. At home we make it with snoek - because it is served with roti and eaten with the hands, we are able to easily remove all the bones. MASALA FISH 30ml (2 tbsp) coriander seeds 30ml (2 tbsp) cumin seeds 10 garlic cloves 2 green chillies 10ml (2 tsp) salt 15ml (1 tbsp) masala mixed spice 5ml (1 tsp) ground turmeric 1kg snoek or other firm fish, cleaned and cut into 6-8 cutlets 45ml (3 tbsp) oil 3 medium tomatoes, thickly sliced Juice of 3 lemons Pound coriander and cumin seeds with garlic, chillies and salt in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder. Add masala and turmeric and mix to form a thick paste. Rub paste into fish cutlets and leave for 15 minutes. Heat oil in a pan and fry fish for 6-8 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Set aside to keep warm. Fry tomatoes in same pan. Place fish on a serving platter, sprinkle with lemon juice and top with tomatoes. Serve with rice and sambals. Serves 6-8 DORAH SITOLE Food consultant and author of \\'Cooking from Cape to Cairo\\' As a nation, we have always been very accommodating of food from other cultures. We tend to embrace it faster than we do our own cuisine. But South Africans are becoming much more willing to try new ingredients and flavours. All the new food markets are testimony to that. I\\'m thrilled to see the growing numbers of young black people at these markets and at food shows. There is a much more relaxed attitude towards food than there was 20 years ago. People are having more fun in the kitchen, hence the blogging craze. More young people - especially men - are finding cooking an exciting hobby. The internet has made it easy to access any recipe and TV food shows have become a trend. Women are far more respected in the SA hospitality industry today, thanks to chefs like Margot Janse, who keep winning major awards, and the many food writers and stylists. There are more women executive chefs than there were 20 years back. It would be nice to see more representation in the executive committees of bodies like the SA Chefs Association. The chicken yassa I made 20 years ago is a national dish of Senegal, so I would be reluctant to interfere with it. The ingredients are easily accessible in SA. I have also made it with fewer onions, added coconut milk and fresh coriander, and changed the name to tangy chicken. CHICKEN YASSA 1 chicken, portioned Salt and pepper 15ml (1 tbsp) mixed masala spice 45ml (3 tbsp) oil 4 onions, sliced 80ml (& 8531; cup) lemon juice 1 fresh green chilli, chopped 500ml (2 cups) chicken stock 10ml (2 tsp) dried mixed herbs Season chicken pieces with salt, pepper and masala. Heat oil in a large pan and fry chicken until brown. Remove chicken and fry onions in same pan until golden. Add chilli, stock and herbs and cook for 5 minutes. Return chicken to pan, remove from heat and leave to marinate for 3 hours or overnight. Gently cook chicken in sauce on a low heat for 1 hour or until tender. Serve over savoury phuthu or rice. Serves 6 THERESA BEUKES Chef owner of Duchess of Wisbeach restaurant in Seapoint, Cape Town The most significant changes I\\'ve seen in the SA food industry over the past 20 years are: the organic food movement, the importance of food provenance, and, sadly, the enormous increase in food costs. I have stopped pushing food boundaries and gone back to refining classics. I have stopped twisting and tweaking my food. I am more fascinated by the honesty of food and nature. I find myself referring more to Elizabeth David than Ottolenghi. I have restaurant patrons who have been eating with me for 20 years. What has changed - besides their age - is that they have a heightened knowledge of and interest in food and are more aware of healthy food. Information technology has played a large part in quicker access to food information. I look forward to seeing more village markets and growth in the farmer-to-table movement. I am thrilled to see young, talented and extremely passionate South African chefs coming into this industry. Our SA food culture is still young, but food has become fashionable. We are exposed to TV chefs and food programmes which are informative and have captured our interest. I think we are still battling within our multicultural society to establish a South African cuisine. I see exciting menus which include unique South African products such as naartjies, guavas, waterblommetjies and biltong. I still make these bobotie spring rolls the same way, but instead of homemade chutney, I give the option of Mrs Ball\\'s chutney, one of SA\\'s unique culinary icons. BOBOTIE SPRING ROLLS 30ml (2 tbsp) butter 30ml (2 tbsp) olive oil 15ml (1 tbsp) grated fresh ginger 15ml (1 tbsp) brown sugar 7.5ml (1& 189; tsp) curry powder 7.5ml (1& 189; tsp) ground turmeric 5ml (1 tsp) salt 2 chives, sliced 500g beef mince 1 thick slice white bread, soaked in water and drained 50g (& 8531; cup) raisins, soaked in sherry or port (optional) 30ml (2 tbsp) chutney 10ml (2 tsp) apricot jam 10ml (2 tsp) white vinegar 10ml (2 tsp) Worcester sauce 15ml (1 tbsp) tomato sauce Handful dried apricots, sliced 80g whole peeled almonds, toasted 1 packet spring roll pastry (or use phyllo pastry) Oil, for deep-frying Heat butter and oil in a large, heavy-based pan and gently stir-fry ginger, sugar, curry powder, turmeric, salt and chives for 5 minutes. Add mince, bread, raisins, chutney, jam, vinegar, Worcester and tomato sauce, apricots and almonds and cook gently for 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Make double layers of spring roll pastry, or use 2 sheets of phyllo pastry cut into 15cm strips. Place 60ml ( cup) of mince mixture into the centre of each strip. Fold in the ends and roll up in a cigar shape. Heat the oil and deep-fry spring rolls until golden brown. Drain on paper towel.

      "Rumblings. SPONGE FROM OTHERS I was making the most alcoholic cake ever created. The \\'cake\\' bit became incidental Cakes are best made by someone else, they just taste better that way. I have known some memorable cakes. First there was the granadilla cake that my teacher Mrs Henderson made for a primary school fête; I made my mother buy it because it looked the best and I was enthralled by the idea of granadilla icing. I will never forget it because I never tasted it - Mum put it down for a minute and someone\\'s dog ate it. I really felt that Mrs Henderson was morally obliged to replace it because it wasn\\'t my fault, but it did not seem to occur to her: such are the Lessons in Life to be learned at primary school. Then there was Mrs Blignaut\\'s jelly cake. She was my high-school friend\\'s mum, and her trick was a cake that intriguingly had jelly crystals in the sponge and icing. They loved that type of packet cooking in the \\'60s and still do in remoter parts of the country where you can\\'t find crème fraîche or mascarpone for love or money. Many years later I found the recipe somewhere and asked Food Weekly editor Hilary Biller to please make it for me; she did and it was pretty disgusting. Maybe you had to be in the \\'60s. Next was a fluffy orange chiffon cake made by Anna Scheepers, long-time president of the Garment Workers Union of SA. She was a large, tough Afrikaans woman who went into a clothing factory as a worker in the Great Depression and became a protégée of the union\\'s general secretary Solly Sachs - the first person to be banned in South Africa. She was an extraordinary baker when not battling for workers\\' rights. I was not, of course, deprived at home. My mother didn\\'t really do iced cakes but rather flapjacks on the coal stove or more traditional English fruit or pound cakes, so named because they originally had a pound of everything in them, apparently. Her favourite, and the family\\'s, was a simple cherry cake baked in a ring. My own enthusiasm for baking seemed stuck on Christmas cakes for decades, then disappeared. It started with a determination to make the richest, darkest cake ever. In went molasses, chocolate, the lot. Then a friend gave me a creole Christmas cake recipe in which you soaked fruit including prunes in five liquors and Angostura bitters for months before baking it. So the goalposts moved to the booziest cake ever, but that one had no nuts. So I re-invented it to include so many whole nuts it resembled concrete. In the end I was simply making a solid slab that was the darkest, richest, spiciest, nuttiest and most alcoholic cake ever created. The \"cake\" bit became incidental. I finally gave up the quest for the ultimate cake when it simply became too expensive to make, and when Eskom expressed interest in buying one in their search for alternative sources of fuel. So back to the belief that cakes are best made by someone else. In a remote village in Alsace, France, I recently tasted a slice of the local Kugelhopf, a light enriched bread baked in a swirly mould. As one does when abroad, I made inquiries about how I could make it at home, and was told that it simply had to be made in a ceramic mould bought there: the metal bunt pans would not do. So I bought one, lugged it back home wrapped in borrowed jerseys, and presented it to the Food Weekly editor with a well-rehearsed look of helplessness. It worked like a charm - within days she arrived in the office with a magnificent Kugelhopf. I believe the recipe is in this issue, so please make it. It\\'s a darned sight nicer than fruit-and-nut concrete. JLF DESIGN/SPARX\n",

      "THE EXCERPT I WALK in the threatening darkness, imagining myself stranded in the night, lying in some corner. This night is going to have me all to itself. My legs continue kicking through my jeans. The insides of my thighs are numb. I am desperate for people, anyone to talk to. I call Tongai; he says he is with Caroline at Trenchtown. Caroline is a Canadian who was with us the previous Saturday at a braai in Observatory. OK, I\\'m coming, I say to Tongai. But Observatory, as I remember when I approach the suburb, is the place of my death. I\\'m not certain I\\'ll make it through or whether I\\'ll decompose there. If I meet them they\\'ll shake my hand like people do at the end of a race. Trenchtown is in Station Road. What will I say to Tongai and Caroline in this state? I decide not to join them. No man knoweth the time nor the day. We do not know what will happen next. We do not even know the season we are in. Rasun, a friend of mine, had the habit of flipping a five-rand coin to decide where we should go out. He was close to the truth, for life is that precarious. I sent him an SMS on Sunday, on my way back from church with Elio, saying that God is great. Rasun responded: \"Dunsky, come back to me when you\\'ve found the secret number.\" I deleted the message immediately. All numbers say something. One represents beginnings, two stretches to infinity; the same holds with the other even numbers. The only stable number is 666. I cannot hold on to this thought. I cross the bridge over the N2 in Mowbray, and the wind makes my eyes water. There\\'s an electrical substation with a grey stoep just before Forest Hill residence. Two old homeless white men used to sit on the stoep. During the day, the more vigorous one could be seen moving between the cars stopped at the traffic lights, imploring the drivers for a few cents. I stayed at Forest Hill when I was doing my postgraduate diploma in accounting. This is where I spent most of my time with Kwanele. As students we drank together and shared plenty of cigarettes. He opened me up to communism. We were bitter, looking for wrong in the world. We were insulting God with all our grief. My head busy, I wander along the road. Around UCT the blue shuttle buses transport students to and from their residences. All I can do is walk. I\\'m in a dream state, eaten up with anxiety. I cannot make sense of it. I am running, rushing somewhere. The worst form of dying is to drown. You go through all the emotions, and think you are going to survive, only to die. My feet pedal above the ground. Stopping is one sure way to madness. I do not want to think about what is happening. I have to keep moving. I glide through Rondebosch, flying in the night. Soon I am in Claremont, KFC, then the taxi rank. The last thing I ate was a piece of chicken this morning. My chest is burning and my throat is as dry as the pavement. I buy a bag of apples and some juice from the ladies at the taxi rank. I eat a green apple. My chest heats up severely, and I water it down with juice. When thinking, hot coals rise to my throat and my thoughts ask each other questions, answer each other, and the answers then break into further possibilities. There is no numbness in my mind.

      "Nando\\'s finds shirking claims too spicy The media is exposing those who plan for tax aggressively ARGUABLY SA\\'s most successful export, Portuguese-style chicken chain Nando\\'s is in the spotlight after Britain\\'s Guardian newspaper claimed it may be shirking its full tax burden with an unnecessarily complex and opaque structure. The paper claimed the owner of Nando\\'s, South African insurance tycoon Dick Enthoven, used a secretive R13.78-billion trust in the Channel Islands to collect royalties and other payments from Nando\\'s franchises through a complicated web of offshore structures. The wealthy Enthoven family also owns insurance company Hollard and wine estate Spier. Nando\\'s structures - which make use of accounting devices in tax havens such as Malta, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Luxembourg - \"significantly reduce the amount of tax the company and the family pay around the world\", the article said. The owners of Nando\\'s \"also legally reduce their UK corporate tax bill by making various permissible payments offshore. Nando\\'s does then pay UK corporation tax on the remainder of its profits.\" But Nando\\'s UK hit back, saying it paid more than R220-million to the UK exchequer in corporate tax last year - 23% of its operating profit. \"Nando\\'s is a family business. It\\'s still owned and run by the people who founded a single chicken shop in South Africa and have grown it to become a global company with 1050 restaurants in 22 countries,\" it said. \"Serving chicken in so many different places does make our parent group\\'s financial structure complex, but we have always been open and honest about the tax we pay in the UK.\" While the Guardian suggested Nando\\'s could be liable for up to 50% more tax than it paid, a Nando\\'s spokesman rubbished this idea. No company in the UK paid 33% corporation tax, he said, which was what Nando\\'s would have to pay with that suggestion. Deborah Tickle, KPMG\\'s director for international corporate tax, said every company was allowed to structure its affairs to be most tax-efficient. \"There is no obligation to pay more than the tax required. What many countries have done is put in place what they call impermissible tax-avoidance legislation, so certain types of avoidance are not acceptable, where there is no commercial rationale behind a transaction.\" But so far Nando\\'s appears to have done nothing illegal. Tickle said these structures were typical not just for the extremely wealthy but for individuals with far fewer assets. \"Assets can be put into a trust for all sorts of reasons,\" she said. But authorities are trying to clamp down on complexity and stop tax base erosion and \"profit shifting\", where companies make profit in one country and shift the cash somewhere else where they are taxed less. While companies can pay only what they\\'re asked to, there is a caveat. \"Reputational risk is an issue, and the media is exposing those who plan for tax aggressively. The Starbucks case is well known here. We\\'re seeing an awareness of it in our clients now, and there\\'s been a definite reduction in appetite for doing something out of the norm,\" Tickle said. Starbucks was hauled over the coals for paying no tax until it was forced to in 2013 - despite its mega UK sales. The South African Revenue Service is only an interested bystander right now. It said that if the Guardian\\'s assumptions were true, the article \"encapsulates the inherent challenges confronting tax administrations regarding base erosion and profit shifting\".\n",

      "HIGHWAY SURFER Heading south on the N9, enjoys some tunes and tales of lost trains on one of South Africa\\'s great drives AS I crested the long, low Free State hill and saw the tin roofs of Springfontein gleaming in the sun, the uneasiness that had followed me like a lost black dog from The Smoke melted away in the breeze. My mood had not been helped by my listening to Sibelius\\'s Finlandia, which may be great music to drive to but perhaps only in Finland. I reached Springfontein later than I\\'d hoped but too early to call it a day and spend the night at Springfontein Lodge, a fine guesthouse that belies the town\\'s dishevelled appearance. I turned off anyway and spent half an hour driving slowly around the town\\'s wide gravel streets, soaking up the silence. Then I put foot for Colesberg and by the time I crossed the Orange River, I had ditched Sibelius for the Kalahari Surfers and decided I had at last found the best road-trip music ever. Soon, the cone-shaped bulk of Cole\\'s Kop loomed up out of the plain and I thought of the sweating gunners of the First Essex Regiment, who\\'d hauled a pair of 15-pounder guns up to the summit in 1899. Then past Colesberg. There is the garage at which a mate and I once spent a freezing July night in his Citi Golf on the way to Grahamstown, me hugging, of all things, a conga drum for warmth. And over there, the silver top of the classic Dutch Reformed Church at the top of Colesberg\\'s main road, glimpsed for seconds between the koppies that hide the town from the road. I paused at the junction where the roads split and watched the cars and trucks heading off into the midday sun on the N1, pleased that I was heading south on the N9 - one of South Africa\\'s great drives. From here, the road leads across spectacular country, where plains roll off to flat-topped koppies on the horizon. After Middelburg, it attacks the northern slopes of the high, cold Sneeuberge that form a protective arc around the Camdeboo and Graaff-Reinet. The road is in excellent shape with few big trucks to foul the air and spoil the view, and on this fine May afternoon I had it all to myself. I had been told that the best slap chips for 500 miles were to be found at the Railway Institute in Noupoort and I was hungry when the scruffy town hove into view a little after 2pm. I like exploring railway towns - although most, like Noupoort, have fallen on hard times after being abandoned by the state railway. Noupoort looks rough but there\\'s a spark of life in the old dog yet, thanks to the Christian Care Centre, which has filled some of the void left by the departing railwaymen. The centre\\'s residents have come from all over southern Africa - \"we even have a guy from Nigeria,\" one of them told me - to this desolate spot to grapple with their various addictions, and it was to their restaurant in the Railway Institute that I now hurried. I waited for the chips in a dining room decorated with crucifixes and pictures of steam trains. The young man who served me was halfway into a 52-week stretch. \"It\\'s hard,\" he said, \"but you learn about self-discipline here.\" I could tell. In the road outside, a crocodile of young men marched past with rakes and shovels, led by a guy wearing what looked like old army fatigues. \"Moooof,\" he said, and the group trailed off down the road. \"How are the chips?\" asked the waiter. \"Lekker. The best in 500 miles, easy.\" When I got back in the car and drove away, I felt ... lucky. I blew through Middelburg, taking instead a quick detour to Rosmead. Once upon a time, when there were still trains to Burgersdorp and Graaff-Reinet, Rosmead was an important place. Now the Graaff-Reinet line is closed and much of the track to Burgersdorp has been stolen by scrap thieves. Rosmead dozed. A trio of purple locomotives stood in the rail yard, waiting for a train that might never come. The only signs of life were a puppy chasing its shadow and a young girl staring through the latticework of the footbridge. I continued southwards. This is my favourite part of the journey. The road and railway run side by side for nearly 30km until the hill becomes too steep for the railway. At a glorious farm called Mazeppa it dives into a kloof, not to be seen again until it meets the road on the far side of the mountain. The road clambers up to the Lootsberg summit, from where you have a brief glimpse of the plains of the Camdeboo in the faraway haze. It gets cold up here and many motorists have been caught out by winter snowfalls. It had been a most satisfying day on the road when I called a halt in Graaff-Reinet. I found a room at Kambro Cottage and went to The Coldstream, a Graaff-Reinet institution, for dinner and rewarded myself with a fine lamb shank and two large goblets of Protea cabernet sauvignon. Afterwards, I toured the nearby Graaff-Reinet Club, a time capsule of militaria and stuffed animal heads on the walls and an exquisite model of one of the locomotives that once steamed up the Lootsberg. Barman James Speelman pointed out the scars on the bar counter from the bullets fired into it by high-spirited Coldstream Guards in 1902. \"Crazy,\" he said, shaking his head, \"crazy.\" In the morning, I went looking for old railwaymen who had worked the pass and found Sam Erasmus, a spry and clear-eyed 84-year-old, working in his garden. He drove trains up the Lootsberg for 20 years. \"It was quite hard with snow and misty rain, the wheels slipping,\" he said. \"We struggled a lot. But we went over the mountain anyway. And the fire kept us warm.\" Talla Crouse, station foreman at Bethesda Road in the bitter winter of \\'65, remembers when snow all but closed the line and he had to inspect it daily on foot. \"I had to walk from Lootsberg to Blouwater [about 14km] through the snow, to see if the trains could get through,\" he said. For six weeks that winter, Crouse lived in a tiny wood and iron cabin at Blouwater siding. He draped a tarpaulin over one side of the lean-to kitchen and stuffed the stove with the coal that passing engine-men threw from their locomotives. \"I let that stove burn red-hot,\" he said. \"Even the baboons came to sit close, they were so cold.\" I could have spent all day listening to their stories but the road was calling. And a fine road it is. I rolled across the plains of the Camdeboo, past Aberdeen and the grassy floodplain that used to be the Beervlei Dam and into the twisties beyond. Seduced by the loveliness of the road, I flew past Willowmore and Uniondale and chased the sun down a valley of pretty farms with names like Molenrivier and Speelmanskraal, gawking at the Outeniqua and Swartberg mountains marching along on each side. Near Camfer, the road splits again. I would have driven into the sunset but there were people waiting for me on the other side of the mountains. Thirty minutes later, I was dangling my legs over the viewpoint at the top of the Outeniqua Pass. After the brown Karoo kilometres, the coastal plain shone like an emerald. Down there in the green was the end of the road but the sun was warm on my back and the air smelled sweet and I was in no hurry.

      "SHELF LIFE cracks open cookbooks that celebrate SA culture (also see pages 6 and 8) WEBER BRAAI BIBLE Jamie Purviance Struik Lifestyle, R290 The braai is a holy tabernacle in SA, so how can the high priest who lights the coals be an American? Actually, this is not as sacrilegious as it sounds. They braai in America too. There they call it a barbecue, and Jamie Purviance, author of what was originally published as The Weber Barbecue Bible (now adapted for the SA market), knows his tongs from his tonsure. A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, Purviance has spent much of his cheffing career developing recipes and experimenting with techniques for the Weber company to get the best results from their equipment. Whichever kind of braai you use, this book contains excellent ideas for outdoor food, including how to smoke a turkey. GIRLS ON FIRE Camilla Comins Russel Wasserfall Food/Jacana Media, R175 \"This is a girl braai book in a boy braai world,\" writes professional cook Camilla Comins. One of her first jobs, after studying at Durban\\'s Christina Martin School of Cookery, was at a bush camp in Botswana where everything had to be cooked on a bed of coals, so she\\'s not afraid of fire. The idea of a braai book for women is twofold: one, to penetrate the masculine curtain drawn around the fire, and two, \"to enjoy braai flavour without having to eat a huge amount of overcooked meat and little else\". You probably wouldn\\'t catch a man putting couscous-stuffed mushrooms on the braai, but they do sound delicious. TRADITIONAL SOUTH AFRICAN COOKING Magdaleen van Wyk & Pat Barton Struik Lifestyle, R180 Purists argue that there is no such thing as \"authentic\" South African food because our culinary traditions have their roots in multiple cultures and countries. Realists counter that the same could be said of almost any national cuisine. Even the French imported a few ingredients and techniques from elsewhere, although they would probably never admit it. Whatever your view, there is something for everyone in the new edition of Traditional South African Cooking. Drawing on Dutch, French, German, British, Malay and indigenous influences, this is an accessible spread of things that South Africans like to eat. COOKED IN THE KAROO Justin Bonello & Helena Lombard Penguin, R350 \"Cooked\" can mean what one does to food, how one feels in the hot Karoo sun, or being in a state of artificially induced hyper-reality. Given the playful nature of SA\\'s culinary explorer, all three meanings are probably implied in the title of this book. As the host of various local TV shows (Pick n Pay\\'s Ultimate Braai Master Season 3 is now on e.tv), Bonello has been almost everywhere in SA and has eaten things most of us might politely decline. Some of those are in this book: sheep tails from Aberdeen; goat sausage, offal and brain from Jansenville ... but there are also loads of country delights that won\\'t scare city dwellers. If it doesn\\'t make you want to eat, this book will at least make you want to travel.\n",

      "Riotous Assembly. Bid to forge agreement to end hostilities founders as opposition battles to speak with one voice Maimane under fire in DA over peace deal Caucus up in arms over leader\\'s \\'soft approach\\' to Ramaphosa We have no \\'Luthuli House culture\\' in the DA THE political deal brokered by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa this week to temper hostilities in parliament came unstuck after DA parliamentary leader Mmusi Maimane faced rebukes from within his caucus. The Sunday Times can reveal that the deal began unravelling on Tuesday after senior DA MPs expressed disagreement over the nature of the pact with Ramaphosa. Maimane, they said, went into the meeting without consulting colleagues, and emerged with nothing but vaguely worded promises. But Maimane has sought to downplay the criticisms, saying he had the support of most party members, and that the DA caucus was a place for \"frank and vigorous\" debates. At this stage, there seems to be no revolt against his leadership, especially after the ANC\\'s hardline politics forced opposition parties to unite. \"Mmusi is our parliamentary leader. Currently, we have no alternative. If he fails, we all fail,\" one DA MP said. Nevertheless, several DA MPs criticised Maimane for agreeing to the terms of Ramaphosa\\'s peace deal on Tuesday, saying he failed to maintain opposition unity after police stormed into the National Assembly. \"I\\'d hate to think he [Ramaphosa] is doing to Mmusi what he did to Roelf Meyer,\" said one prominent MP, referring to Ramaphosa\\'s negotiating tactics during the democratic transition. \"Well, we\\'ve certainly lost our swagger,\" said another DA MP. The MPs felt Maimane revealed a lack of experience and could have driven a harder bargain over President Jacob Zuma\\'s failure to appear in the House and allegations of bias on the part of Speaker Baleka Mbete. The ANC and opposition parties held a meeting on Tuesday night, with the ruling party represented by Gerhard Koornhof (parliamentary councillor to Ramaphosa), ANC Chief Whip Stone Sizani, Deputy Justice Minister John Jeffery and Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. DA MPs included Maimane, Mike Waters, John Steenhuisen and Geordin Hill-Lewis. The ANC wanted the DA to withdraw the motion to censure Zuma, and Maimane seemed to agree, but the rest of the DA delegation refused. The eventual outcome has been variously interpreted. The DA claimed it was decided that the motion would be discussed the next day. The ANC said they agreed that the motion would be softened or withdrawn. Each side has since accused the other of bad faith. Shortly after the deal fell apart, DA MPs met at an extraordinary caucus meeting. At least three MPs raised concerns and Maimane was hauled over the coals, but there was also support for his concern that parliament continued to function. DA MPs were also unhappy that Maimane had agreed to serve as co-deputy of a cross-party political discussion committee, a move they said would blur the lines separating the executive from the legislature. Pressures from within the party also explain why Maimane forged ahead with his motion to censure Zuma on Wednesday, which took both Ramaphosa and the ANC by surprise after the apparent agreement. On Friday Maimane confirmed that the initial agreement had caused disquiet in his party, but he said he had the support of most party members. \"I took the caucus through the agreement and what had been negotiated, and the whole caucus was supportive, he said. \"In the DA, we don\\'t expect that every member of the caucus must blindly follow the instructions of the party leadership. \"We have no \\'Luthuli House culture\\' in the DA. Our caucus is always a place of frank and vigorous debate, and that is exactly how we like it to be.\" DA leader Helen Zille said she had no say in the matter and that Maimane needed nobody\\'s mandate when he met Ramaphosa. \"He went in there with no mandate. He\\'s quite capable as the parliamentary leader to make up his mind as to how to proceed with the DA\\'s mandate.\"\n",

      "PAWS & PLAY Once dogs made her nervous. Now Maggy Mokoena is leader of the pack, offering a walkies service for busy suburbanites. By Photograph: Moeletsi Mabe TO climb into Maggy Mokoena\\'s van is to be hurtled into a yapping, drooling orgy of fur. Mokoena walks dogs, at R25 a pooch. Because, like the guys who brave vertiginous heights to clean skyscraper windows, someone has to. Mutts of every description vie for space. Shaggy, short-haired. Uptown bitches and backstreet mongrels, rescued from the sewers and tethered with golden collars. It\\'s a kind of Rand Club for hounds in which the pedigreed and pedicured of doggy society get to socialise, and maybe even enjoy a walk. I sit in a slowly drying pool of slobber. Getting into the diesel-farting jalopy I nearly squashed a puppy with a coal-black snout and don\\'t-eat-me eyes. The owner isn\\'t sure but his great uncle may have been a German shepherd. \"I was afraid of dogs,\" Mokoena tells me on her pickup route, the car lurching along Beyers Naudé Drive like a snarling bulldog. A domestic worker when she\\'s not exercising hounds, she grew to love her boss\\'s dogs. From Tzaneen and now living in Albertville, she started the side business nine months ago to earn extra money for her three sons. She called it \"Happy Dog Walker\" - it\\'s uncertain if the dogs are meant to be happy, or she is - and painted the words in happy colours on the side of the van. It\\'s how many clients find out about her. Her sneakers are hard-worn. She\\'s as calm as her clients are wild. \"You have to like dogs. It\\'s like working with kids. If I don\\'t like your kids, then I can\\'t work with you ... Morti! Back!\" Mortimer, a leggy blonde and one of her nine regulars, has heaved himself onto the passenger seat with me. I learn that he gets carsick. Next stop: Montgomery Park. Mokoena lets herself in. The owner, at work, gave her a code. Two black dogs are already waiting at the gate. They know the drill. They were Mokoena\\'s first clients. Dakota has satellite-dish ears and a tail curved like a question mark. \"She didn\\'t like the others at first,\" says Mokoena. \"She didn\\'t want to leave the van. Now she\\'s more confident.\" Bobby the runt, on the other hand, has wedged himself under the car seat and is trying to resemble a floor mat. Mokoena has to shout over baritone barks, toenails scraping on metal as the pooches skid about. Tails wag like demented clock hands. The energy has reached a fever pitch. At Emmarentia Dam, Morti explodes out of the van - a cannonball of fur - with the grace of an inebriated hippo. Mokoena is no-nonsense. Even when she gets entangled in the leashes, she extricates herself with Nureyev-like grace. Lift left leg. Spin 360°. She\\'s as hard-arsed as a post-apocalyptic cockroach. \"No I don\\'t pick up poo. There\\'s a guy here who does that.\" Once a friend of mine got pulled over because there was a drunken blonde in the car without a seatbelt. Turns out it was a golden retriever. No, she hasn\\'t been pulled over, says Mokoena. No, they\\'ve never eaten any geese. \"These dogs are well-trained.\" It\\'s true. They haven\\'t so much as whizzed on a tyre. Then there\\'s Group B. The delinquents. They prowl the park like bullies in a school corridor. Mokoena has to walk them on a different day. \"They shout at me. I shout back. One is a biter.\" The owner had to pay another dog\\'s medical bills. Another Group B member, Mad Max, has a tendency to dash for the hills. Or the nearest pub. \"Once it took us three hours to find him.\" Cathelijn Sandler, a busy GP from the Netherlands, hired Mokoena to walk her dogs, Mortimer and Charlie (short for Charlotte), one of those ugly-beautiful dogs who looks like Marlene Dietrich after a bar fight. When she found him he was a bag of bones at the SPCA. \"My dogs are important,\" she says. Finding the right dog walker was like interviewing for a nanny. \"I asked her lots of questions.\" She even went along on the first walk. \"I wanted to see how she was with my dogs and if she\\'d be able to get them back on the lead. People steal dogs. I also wanted to make sure they got a proper walk and she didn\\'t just park the van in the parking lot. And I asked her not to let Morti swim.\" He\\'s prone to ear infections. For Sandler, it was a bit of a novelty. \"You don\\'t get a lot of dog walkers in Holland.\" It\\'s 3:44pm and we\\'re headed back home. The smell of dirt and wet fur is so engrained in the upholstery that the van\\'s next owner will forever be looking for stowaway hounds in his rear-view mirror. On the way I see Mad Max, wild-eyed, behind an iron gate, plotting his next escape. \"Have any hobbies?\" I ask Mokoena. \"Yes,\" she says. \"Sleeping.\" LS •Contact Happy Dog Walker on 0839556862 or 0828562042.

      "THE MARIKANA REPORT. Poorly trained police under fire \\'Can\\'t even disarm someone with an axe without bloodshed\\' THE SAPS\\'s public order police and other units are so ill-equipped and inadequately trained that if a crowd were to storm the Union Buildings they would be unable to stop them. This damning finding and several other deficiencies in the police were among those included in retired Judge Ian Farlam\\'s report. Farlam, who headed the Marikana commission, was scathing on the conduct of the police during the events of August 2012, and has recommended that officers be charged criminally. The report includes a part where Cees de Rover, a police expert called by the SAPS, told of an incident where public order police members \"ran away from the scene during the attack by the strikers upon their colleagues\", which he had described as the \"abject failure\" of public order policing. \"[De Rover] said the strikers on the 13th, and more so on the 16th, appeared confrontational, organised, mobile, armed, violent and volatile. \"He went so far as to say that none of the units in the SAPS has the ability to stop a crowd with those characteristics if they decided to walk into the Union Buildings,\" says the report. Based on this and other evidence led during the Marikana commission, Farlam called for the total overhaul of public order policing using local and international experts. Farlam hauled the public order police over the coals for using automatic rifles, saying that experts were unanimous in their view that such heavy weaponry was not suitable for public order policing. \"De Rover testified that he suggested an immediate withdrawal of the R5 from [public order policing] operations. He said that military assault weapons have no place in law enforcement and that he was fully aware of the particular problems of violence in South Africa,\" the report states. The evidence indicated that R5 bullets tend to disintegrate when entering the body. The commission also found that police could not even disarm someone with an axe without involving bloodshed. The commission was mindful of the dangers inherent in the situation when public order police members were faced with a crowd armed with sharp weapons and where nonlethal force was ineffective. \"However, the use of [an] R5 or any automatic rifle is clearly untenable, not only because of the constitutional imperatives, but also because the effects seen at Marikana are just too disturbing and devastating for South Africa even to contemplate any recurrence,\" says the report. In his recommendations, Farlam called for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) to investigate the police action in Marikana. Farlam recommended that, for the purposes of the investigation, \"a team should be appointed, headed by a senior state advocate, together with independent experts in the reconstruction of crime scenes, expert ballistic and forensic pathologist practitioners and senior investigators from Ipid, and any such further experts as may be necessary\". He also called for a full investigation by the North West director of public prosecutions. \"The director of public prosecutions [will] exercise his powers ... to supervise, direct and co-ordinate a specific investigation into the events at scenes one and two.\" The report says the officers who fired shots at the strikers \"may have exceeded the bounds of self- and private defence\". Farlam also slammed the lack of medical assistance for injured miners and recommended that all police units be trained in first aid. He said the commission recommended a full investigation, under the direction of the director of public prosecutions, to ascertain criminal liability on the part of all members of the SAPS who were involved in the events. On police equipment, Farlam recommended that all radio communications be recorded and the recordings preserved. All police helicopters should be equipped with functional video cameras, he said. olifantn@sundaytimes.co.za VOLATILE SITUATION: Mineworkers armed with traditional weapons attempt to overrun a police Nyala at Marikana on August 16 2012 .

      "Poor judgment writ large as candidates vie for the bench WHILE many \"exemplary candidates\" applied this week to become high court judges, some of those before the Judicial Service Commission in Cape Town seemed to be less than ideal for the job. PERCIVAL MASETI THE past came back to haunt Maseti when he was hauled over the coals on Monday for not disclosing a previous conviction for accepting a bribe while a prosecutor. Maseti, who applied for a seat at the High Court in Johannesburg, was paid R50 by a man charged with assault, more than 35 years ago. Maseti was sentenced to six months in prison. He claimed this was partially due to the political climate at the time. He said he had been kicked out of university and had to become a prosecutor. He told the JSC: \"It is my contention that the purpose of the court sentencing me was not to punish me but to allow me to cool down, relax and consider my future and undergo corrective training in terms of character and to make sure that in the future I operate above board and, in a nutshell, this was a wake-up call.\" He said since that incident he was \"a new-born, a new man\". MANDLA MBONGWE MBONGWE, also up for the Gauteng division, was nailed on Monday for his conduct as a trial judge by both the bar council and the commission. In a very \"unusual move\" the Supreme Court of Appeal slated the \"unacceptable manner\" in which Mbongwe had conducted a domestic violence case in which a woman sued the minister of police. The appeal court\\'s deputy president, Judge Mandisa Maya, said the court was \"horrified\" by Mbongwe\\'s \"unwarranted interruptions\" in the case, which bordered on discourtesy and \"cynicism\" towards witnesses and counsel. PETER FISCHER THE nephew of the late Bram Fischer did not live up to his uncle\\'s reputation. On Wednesday he interviewed for a position in the Free State division of the high court. Asked \"Why does gender equity matter?\", the advocate responded in a way that left spectators cringing. \"Hell hath no fury like a [woman scorned] ... but sometimes women are more level-headed and inclined to be much less agitated,\" he said. He also said that while men were egotistical, \"women bring balancing and a placating atmosphere to that reality\". He added that \"women bring a soft, motherly approach\". SHANAAZ MIA ON Wednesday, magistrate Mia, who applied for the Free State division of the high court, was quizzed on whether she helped a colleague to write her judgments. Mia denied doing so, saying she merely made comments and suggestions. The commission revealed that the colleague she is said to have assisted, magistrate Judith van Schalkwyk, is facing an inquiry by the Magistrate\\'s Commission. Van Schalkwyk is charged with misconduct, including gambling during office hours, instructing subordinates to do her hair, and getting others to write her judgments for her.

      "Ties with Israel \\'normal\\' as ANC roasted RELATIONS with Israel have not been strained, says South Africa\\'s ambassador to Israel, Sisa Ngombane, despite a senior diplomat being hauled over the coals after a recent meeting between Hamas and the ANC. Ngombane\\'s political adviser, Musa Marawu, was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tel Aviv on Monday to be read the riot act over the ANC\\'s hosting of Hamas leaders on a week-long visit to South Africa. Israeli foreign affairs deputy director-general Yoram Elron told Marawu, who stood in for Ngombane as the ambassador was down with flu, that his government was \"shocked, dismayed and disappointed\" by the ANC\\'s decision to meet a party Israel regards as a terrorist body. Diplomatic sources in Pretoria say Elron further accused the South African government of sending \"contradictory messages\" to Israel by encouraging negotiations between it and Palestine \"while on the other hand engaging Hamas\", a party \"committed to the eradication and destruction\" of Israel. In June, President Jacob Zuma appointed former deputy foreign affairs minister Aziz Pahad as his presidential envoy to Israel and Palestine in a bid to revive stalled negotiations. On Monday, Hamas leaders, including its chief, Khaled Meshaal, met Zuma and senior ANC leaders at Luthuli House. Since the ANC was the ruling party, Elron told Marawu, the meeting was akin to the South African government meeting Hamas. The ANC has defended its decision, saying this was in line with its policy of showing solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for statehood. Elron lodged a formal protest with Marawu and told him to convey to the South African government that Israel saw the ANC\\'s meeting with Hamas as the government\\'s embrace of a \"terrorist group\". But Marawu is said to have told Elron that Israel\\'s accusations were unfounded as Hamas had met the ANC, not the South African government. Ngombane on Friday played down the fallout over Israel, saying relations between the two countries remained cordial. \"I think it was a misunderstanding on their part, but it is just playing politics to criticise the government when in reality it was the ANC that met Hamas. We know they view Hamas as a terrorist organisation, but in negotiations every party must be engaged,\" said Ngombane. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said his party had met Hamas to find solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \"If you want a solution on the Palestinian question, you talk to everybody. Then you\\'ll find a solution. If you want a solution that excludes others, you will not find a solution,\" he said. The South African Jewish Board of Deputies said the ANC should use its contact with Hamas to urge the organisation \"to abandon terrorism and violence and commit ... to a process of peaceful negotiations\". Chairwoman Mary Kluk said the ANC was \"in a position to influence the Hamas leadership in abandoning inflammatory and profoundly racist notions\".

That goes double when the freeway is in Mumbai, triple at rush-hour and exponentially more when said human being is on foot. But, as a chunk of the city\\'s population of 22-million oozed their way to work and wherever else in a grumpy hurry one morning this week, there she was: a little old lady in a purple sari. Walking in the middle of the freeway. In Mumbai. At rush-hour. She had crossed several lanes to get there and was clearly bent on crossing several more. Whatever was on the mind she may not have had, stopping was not. Instead, brandishing nothing more than a glare down the road as steady as the hand she held out, palm up and defiant, to her side in the same direction, she stopped the traffic. That done, she strode through the staggered but unbroken line of gaps between the cars unscathed and unbowed to perform a miracle that made walking on hot coals barefoot - or even on water - look like flipping a beer mat. It is a scene South Africa would do well to keep in mind as they contemplate the staggering achievement that dangles within their grasp. Only twice have teams played series in all three formats on one tour to India. Neither of those sides have won all three. With the one-day international (ODI) and Twenty20 trophies at stake on this tour already in South Africa\\'s luggage, they will complete the royal flush if they win the test series that starts in Mohali on Thursday. In any event, South Africa are in rare company as only the fourth team to come away from India having won the test and ODI series on the same visit. What are the chances? SA have not gone down in an away test series in nine years and there are just three drawn rubbers amid all that success. However, India are not the little old ladies that might make them seem. Indeed, they have lost just one of the 17 test series they have played at home in the past 10 years. Moreover, Ravichandran Ashwin, the spinner who bothered SA\\'s batsmen the most out of all India\\'s bowlers in the T20 series but was then removed from the equation in the first ODI, will be back in Mohali. And the visitors can be sure all four pitches in the series will be among the driest they will see in their careers. But South Africa have tended to get their retaliation in first. Since readmission, in bilateral engagements of at least three matches regardless of the format, they have gone on to claim the rubber 54 times when they have won the first game. When they have lost the opening match, they have also lost the series 21 times. And, on this tour, they won the first Twenty20 as well as the opening match of the ODI series. Not that such flights of fancy will be on Hashim Amla\\'s mind. SA\\'s captain has averaged more than 50 in eight of the last nine test series in which he has had more than one innings. His career average has remained above 50 for 20 tests stretching back to November 2012. But, in seven innings in India, he has averaged 18.14 and has yet to reach 40, never mind 50. That might make him nervous in light of what Dane Vilas said this week about the increasingly fierce competition for places in South Africa\\'s XI. \"If you are secure in your position it\\'s not great for a team. Everyone wants to get into this team now and everyone wants to play against a quality side like India.\" Not that Amla is much like other players. Instead, he will value the pressure to succeed. Perhaps that\\'s what made the little old lady cross the freeway. sports@timesmedia.co.za ON EDGE: Hashim Amla has been below his best in IndiaPicture: EPA\n",

      "Spectre of Sparrow saga haunts \\'no-to-racists\\' DA Party leader in KwaZulu-Natal lambasted for statement during \\'monkey\\' storm THE DA\\'s KwaZulu-Natal leader, Zwakele Mncwango, has been hauled over the coals for publicly announcing that Penny Sparrow was a member of the party shortly after her racist Facebook post. The Sunday Times has learnt that DA chief whip John Steenhuisen and chairman Athol Trollip allegedly chastised Mncwango on Friday during the party\\'s federal executive meeting for going public about Sparrow\\'s membership. She was expelled from the DA after writing the post in which she referred to black beachgoers as monkeys. \"[Steenhuisen and Trollip] said Mncwango\\'s admission gave the ANC ammunition ... They said Mncwango could have delayed confirming Sparrow\\'s membership by telling the media he was still verifying the information,\" said a leader who attended the meeting. \"He argued that the DA was a transparent party and protecting her could have led the party to lose its credibility.\" Another source quoted Mncwango as having defended his actions by saying it was in the interests of the party to expose such individuals. \"He became emotional. The DA membership system is electronic; it took him a few minutes to confirm her membership.\" In what could be interpreted as Mncwango venting his frustration after the meeting, he wrote on Facebook: \"It\\'s not usual for me to be angry for more than an hour. I really need some introspection. Anger is not healthy [and has a] psychological effect. All I wish is to be home right now.\" Mncwango refused to comment on the meeting. Steenhuisen denied the allegations saying they were \"completely untrue\". The Mncwango incident came three days after DA leader Mmusi Maimane delivered a speech on race in which he vowed to rid the party of racist elements. The party has been battling accusations of racism - with the ANC using every pretext to throw mud at it. Friday\\'s meeting also decided to launch an all-out campaign to get the party\\'s members and elected representatives to voluntarily sign a pledge against racism, announced by Maimane on Tuesday. At the meeting the party\\'s top leadership rallied behind the pledge, although some reservations were expressed about the exact wording. Maimane has a mountain to climb if he wants the party\\'s MPs and senior staff to become more representative. The DA\\'s MPs and its top staff managers are overwhelmingly white, according to figures obtained this week. The parliamentary caucus is 66% white, 21% black, 8% coloured and 5% Indian. Although an exact racial breakdown of voting patterns is impossible because race is not indicated on the ballot, the DA estimates that its support among black South Africans grew from 0.8% in 2009 to about 6% in 2014, which would mean about 760000 blacks voted for it. The party believes its support among Indians grew from 53.7% in 2009 to 61% in 2014, among coloureds from 55.5% to 67.7% and whites from 83.9% to 92.8%. Maimane said on Tuesday DA structures must set targets for the recruitment and development of candidates for public office. He said it would be done without \"resorting to dehumanising quotas that reduce human beings to statistics\", but did not explain further. Prominent DA members have largely backed his call. His predecessor as DA parliamentary leader, Lindiwe Mazibuko, called the speech an \"outstanding initiative\" in her column in Business Day, but was critical of the how the party dealt with race internally. She referred to \"the almost exclusive dominance of white males within the party\\'s \\'brains trust\\'\". DA MPs who spoke to the Sunday Times largely supported Maimane\\'s call, though some, speaking on condition of anonymity, argued that it could unleash racial \"bean-counting\". Federal council chairman James Selfe said Maimane\\'s requirement had yet to be \"operationalised\" and this would start to happen at the meeting over the weekend. Trollip declined to comment yesterday. shobas@sundaytimes.co.za joubertj@sundaytimes.co.za vanonseleng@sundaytimes.co.za CRUNCHING THE FIGURES: Party leader Mmusi Maimane wants the DA\\'s leadership structures to be reflective of the South African population.

This time, they have their eye on the consolation prize of the one-day series. Victory today will give them that, at least. But England are also a win away from claiming that prize, and from completing the double of winning the test and one-day international series - a comet that last came round for a team visiting South Africa in 2002. This contestable crescendo is what sport strives for when it couldn\\'t be bothered with nuance. It\\'s a gripping script that has been followed perfectly in this case; from England winning the first two matches as easily as if they were slugging a couple of cold pints on a hot day, to SA only just catching the boerewors as it slipped through the grid towards the coals to level matters going into today\\'s decider. Holding the tongs is AB de Villiers: \"We know what it feels like being 2-0 down; it\\'s a horrible feeling and you don\\'t really know where to go except to go out there and fight it out as much as you can. \"Hopefully we\\'ve got enough confidence and momentum on our side. But the game will start at 0-0 and we\\'ve got to find a way to get the momentum going [today].\" Damon Runyon could have banged out a fine version of the story thus far, but JK Rowling might have been responsible for what happened at the Wanderers on Friday. So much so that someone should check Chris Morris\\' forehead for a scar resembling a lightning bolt. At 28, he is the boy whose team lived because of his outrageous 62. Morris is the reason South Africa still have a shot at winning the series. In the pink unreality of it all, he earned the unconditional love of what used to be his home crowd. On social media, he earned a nickname - \"Chuck Morris\" - and at least one proposal of marriage. From a straight man who is already married. \"To win a game for your country, doesn\\'t matter what format, is a special feeling,\" Morris said. \"I\\'m just happy I could contribute, but in saying that I\\'m happy I got some runs under my belt - it was nice to hit a few out of the park.\" And it was nice for De Villiers to watch them disappear into the night sky. \"It\\'s knocks like that that shape a player,\" he said. \"It\\'s massive for Chris. The game and sport is about confidence. Knocks like this push someone way above the bar. It\\'s so big for him and the team.\" Indeed, in team terms, Morris has answered some of the questions SA have been asking themselves about where their next allrounder will come from. Morris started answering them the last time he took on England at Newlands. His silkily scored 69 was not the kind of thing expected from bowlers who have been hammered for 150 runs on their test debut.

      "LONG BEACH GOLF AND SPA RESORT Belle Mare Reviewed by LOCATION: Under an hour from the airport, Long Beach is situated on the east coast of Mauritius. It is a five-minute drive to the small village of Poste de Flacq, where you can access a supermarket and a few clothing shops. While the rockier northern beaches are similar to KwaZulu-Natal\\'s coastline, the east is all about white sand; still, clear shallows and blue beyonds. It is ideal for little children, even close to high tide. It\\'s also a short drive and ferry to Ile Aux Cerfs for golf and swimming. STYLE AND DÉCOR: Fresh, clean and modern. This is an eco-friendly hotel using open-air, light-maximising and natural materials. Common spaces are arty, sometimes futuristic, with sea themes. Giant pebbles to sit on in the lobby; azure-hued cushions and couches; waterfalls and Japanese-style zen water features keep it cool. The rooms are decorated in citrous tones. The slate tiles are wonderful for the heat, though slippery when wet. We loved the open piazza, surrounded by five restaurants, which leads onto the beach bar, then a grassy lawn before the seashore. The adults-only infinity pool is hidden away for privacy. The main pool is a design masterpiece. Semi-private areas, a jacuzzi section, several baby- and child-friendly areas and loungers of various styles everywhere. It merges onto the beach, where there are more loungers, bean bags and sun beds, all within service range. SERVICE: Happy, friendly and obliging. You may come across the occasional hiccup regarding the half-board/all-inclusive issue. It is a kind of economic apartheid that causes confusion at times. Generally, they do their best. EATING: There are five restaurants - all spectacular. Breakfast and buffet at Le Marche; Sapori, the Italian restaurant; wicker chairs and sea-shore dining at Tides; the Chinese and Japanese restaurants, Chopsticks and Hasu. Dinner options are either buffet or à la carte, three courses at your chosen restaurant. Everyone pays extra at Hasu. The buffet at Le Marche is themed nightly and, unlike the mass-produced budget meals at some hotels, the five-star difference means good quality roasts, top-notch seafood and authentic world cuisine. On the Asian evening, there were fresh Peking duck spring rolls, several rice and noodle dishes, curries and grills on hot coals. For lunches, poolside, there are fabulous pizzas (R300), salads and sandwiches. Kids\\' meals are chicken or fish nuggets, expensive at around R120. The all-inclusive packages make sense if you eat and drink a lot. Out-of-package drinks and food are pricey, as with most resorts on the island. ACTIVITIES: If you have kids, don\\'t bother touring. It is hot, expensive and mostly unimpressive. We did a trip to the muggy and mosquito-drenched Pamplemousses Botanical Gardens for around R2000, to see a pond of giant lily pads and pitiful tortoises. Do visit the Ganga Talao temple for a spiritual experience, otherwise hotel watersports should happily occupy a visitor with the best thing to do in Mauritius, which is enjoy the sea. Long Beach has paddle boats and kayaks, glass-bottomed boat cruises and snorkelling for guests. BEST TIME TO GO: It is tropical all year round. Hot and humid with the occasional downpour. FACILITIES: Kids\\' club, nightclub and baby-sitting services. There are cooking demos, evening entertainment and an exercise programme with sunrise yoga, a fitness centre, tennis and a spa. Also a complimentary shuttle, ferry and green fees for golfers to Ile Aux Cerfs. If you want to visit as a non-golfer, the taxi fare is about R800 and the ferry is free. Excellent wifi throughout the resort. DOWNSIDES: Ants and a few stray cats and dogs, but children seem to love them all. RATES: Season dependent, it starts at around R5000 per room, per night, half board for two people and two children in a 62m² room. The all-inclusive packages were an additional R2000 per day in March. Discovery Vitality members get discounts on World Leisure Holiday trips. CONTACT: Visit wlh.co.za or longbeachmauritius.com.

      "Crèche Course. Couple\\'s church expands to include crèches, orphanages, a farm and income-generating projects Mtubatuba\\'s children eat, pray, love in safety It had to become more than just a church service. It was too painful to see the poverty and social injustices in the community The free-range eggs are sold to bed and breakfast establishments in St Lucia and chickens are sold to locals LITTLE faces light up when Angela McLaren joins them on a mat on the concrete floor of her crèche in Mtubatuba, northern KwaZulu-Natal. The small building, surrounded by rural houses and sugar cane fields, comes to life with the melody of Zulu nursery rhymes. Angela and Keith McLaren started the Zwelisha crèche and learning facility in 2005. The staff consists of trained caregivers and a teacher. The children get up and move to their classroom, where Buhle Msane is ready to teach them colours with the use of colourful balls. Angela, 60, a former teacher, and her husband, Keith, 62, a pastor, left Durban in November 1994 for Mtubatuba. Their intention was to spread the gospel, but they found themselves empowering the community by establishing crèches and an orphanage. \"Things were a lot different from what we expected. People were in such poverty. It had to become more than just a church service. It was too painful to see the children\\'s neglect, poverty, social injustices and unemployment in the community. \"Our priority was to take care of the children. While their mothers went to work in the fields, the children would be left at home to fend for themselves. We once found a child abandoned and with a big belly from eating sand. These children crawl out of their huts and eat sand to counter the hunger pangs. We decided to open daycare centres for the children,\" said Angela. From one crèche it has grown to three - Zwelisha crèche, Silethokuhle crèche and Khanyeni crèche, with about 200 children altogether, as well as an orphanage - Lakithi Children\\'s Home - which is situated on the Edwaleni church property and is home to nine children aged seven to 17. \"After starting Edwaleni church we were informed by our son Ross that many of the children had told him they were sleeping in the surrounding bush. We provided meals from our home kitchen, as well as an ablution facility. We bought school uniforms and paid their school fees, but accommodation remained a problem,\" said Keith. After many struggles and promises of venues and properties, they bought a property - an old trading complex with ample buildings and outbuildings - on seven hectares. \"Children staying with us attend school and church and are involved in the income-generating projects on site. This helps them learn skills and earn pocket money,\" said Keith. The projects include egg farming and chicken farming and, more recently, growing vegetables. They have started a bakery, which is also part of their skills training. Keith said they relied on the projects to sustain the crèches and orphanage. \"The free-range eggs are sold to bed and breakfast establishments in St Lucia and chickens are sold to locals. Through the projects we are able to pay staff salaries. The crèches are all government registered, but are not receiving any funding. \"We are disillusioned by welfare staff,\" said Keith. Maintaining the crèches and orphanage costs almost R40000 a month. Keith said every week brought a new challenge. \"I am always looking for ideas to help the people from the community generate an income. We train people at the church to bake using a coal stove. If they have an interest, then we help set up a business,\" he said. The establishment of an aquaponics farm, an initiative to produce vegetables such as lettuce using 90% less water, is one of their latest ideas. Eunice Gwala, 67, who used to make grass mats to earn a living, now bakes 30 loaves of bread a day; she sells them to parents whose children are at Zwelisha crèche. \"I am so happy to have learnt to bake bread. I know I am guaranteed to sell them as the parents place orders. I sell them for R8, while at the shop it is R11. I make a profit of R4 a loaf, which I save and use to pay for the premix and flour,\" said Gwala. At the crèche the children are provided with two meals a day and follow a programme of structured lessons, playtime and physical activities. \"The feedback I receive from schools which the children go to for Grade R is that children from here cope very well. \"We are happy that the crèche provides a happy and safe place and is a central point for moms and dads,\" said Angela. Florence Hlope, 42, works as a grass cutter while her year-old child Asphile attends the crèche. Hlope said she was so happy to have a place to leave her child. \"It is close to my work. There is no one at home to take care of my child,\" said Hlope. In their earlier days in Mtubatuba, the McLarens focused on HIV/Aids in the community. The difficulty was that people did not want to be tested and teenagers did not want to take their antiretrovirals. Angela said their priority was to provide a healthy and holistic home that is safe for the children. \"It is scary and sad when we hear of young girls, aged 11 and 12, shacking up with cane cutters. We would report it to the police. The police would speak to the man ... the girls can\\'t resist the lure of being wanted. \"We try to teach the children, especially those living at the orphanage, responsibility and to educate themselves to improve their lives and their society,\" she said. \"We are happy to be making a difference in a significant way in the lives of this community,\" said Keith. pillayt@sundaytimes.co.za TOTS: Thandi Mkhwanazi and Nomusa Sithole care for children at the crèche GOSPEL: The church in Mtubatuba run by Keith and Angela McLaren YELLOW: Buhle Msane teaching children at Zwelisha crèche PLAYGROUND: Children play at Zwelisha crèche in Mtubatuba, KwaZulu-Natal GROWING: Angela and Keith McLaren in a mealie field on their property in Mtubatuba HELPING HAND: Angela McLaren with a toddler at the crèche Pictures: JACKIE CLAUSEN\n",

      "The sound of SILENCE finds peace, quiet and old stories in the valley of the Sundays River PRETORIUSKLOOF has a profound kind of stillness. Yes, there were birds chattering in the trees, and the gentle clatter of the wind-pump\\'s vanes, water splashing in regular gurgles into the round cement tank behind the house. But that - and the panting of a sweet-natured, overheated German shepherd named Tupac - was all. No phones, no fridge, no generators. No hum of electricity or TV or cellphones or radio. Apart from the occasional farmer\\'s bakkie, which you may or may not hear according to which way the wind is blowing, no sound of traffic either - no highway roar or racebikes howling past in the faraway night. After the hum of the road and the chatter of our lives, arriving at the farm Letskraal, 17km down an iffy dirt road from the N9, was at first unsettling. We spoke in whispers so as not to offend the silence. An hour later and I knew that of all things in this world, this deep well of quiet is what I craved most. That and taking a leaf out of Tupac\\'s book and plopping down in the shade of a cypress to gaze with soft eyes at mountains folding away into the haze. It was hot, of course, in this valley where the Sundays River winds between high, rocky hills, so we sat quietly until the heat began to fade and dusk softened the hills. I thought: how could anyone ever leave this place? So it must have been for Andries Pretorius, whose farm this was when Sarel Cilliers came calling in 1838 to ask for his help with the Voortrekkers in far-off Natal. A copy of the notice of sale is framed in the dining room: \"Public Sale Without Reserve\" for the place \"Lets-kraal, in extent about 4000 morgens, planted with 7000 vines 100 orange trees and a variety of other fruit trees; has a substantial Dwelling House, Cellar, Smith, Wagon-maker\\'s Shop and a water mill.\" A separate notice from the auctioneer gushed about the house and the farm. Of the garden, it said: \"This is without exception one of the finest in the district. Immediately in front of the house is an orange grove and large orchard, well kept and in good order ... \" The orchard and most of the vines are gone now and yet looking out across the open field, everything feels \"in good order\". Apart from having a tin roof in place of the original thatch, the house is pretty much as it was in 1838 - a whitewashed longhouse built of mud and straw, with large, cool rooms leading into each other. There is a kitchen with a wood-fired stove at the back and a wide, swept sand yard with enough room to turn a wagon and span of oxen. Whoever acquired the farm clearly looked after it. When Bishop Robert Grey passed this way from Cape Town in October 1850, he wrote in the visitor\\'s book: \"Comfortable quarters on a farm which is a very beautiful one and once belonged to the rebel Pretorius.\" The farm now belongs to Graaff-Reinet optometrist Johan Minnaar, who spent much of his childhood here in the kloof, back when trains used to come huffing up the long climb from the Sundays River. The railway cuts right through Letskraal farm but is hidden by trees and old growth. Officially closed in 1993, the line has seen scant trains since then, although it was nominally reopened by Transnet this year. Back in the 1970s and \\'80s, though, it was something of a lifeline, not only for the farmers in the kloof, but also for the Minnaar family. \"In my childhood, if it rained the roads would be impassable so we would go home by train - the goods train, in the guard\\'s van,\" he says. Later, when he was studying at Wits Tech, he used the weekly passenger train from Mossel Bay to get back to Joburg at the end of the December holidays. \"My dad would phone the stationmaster [in Graaff-Reinet] and ask if the train could stop at Letskraal. The train would stop and everyone would hang out to see why. And it\\'s high to get all my trunks and stuff onto the train - and in under five minutes because they got fined if they weren\\'t punctual,\" says Minnaar. \"It was quite embarrassing, and my mom would be there with her hankie, waving goodbye to her youngest son.\" The train would steam out of Letskraal at 10am and only reach Noupoort - some 100km away - at 5pm. \"If I\\'d had a car, I would have been in Joburg already,\" he says. That slow northward trek was thanks to the Sneeuberg, which the railway crosses by a perilous and steep defile known to engine drivers simply as \"Lootsberg\", one of the toughest railway passes in Africa. I recently tracked down some railwaymen who had worked the pass and crept slowly through the kloof where fallen rocks could throw a train off the tracks. Samuel Erasmus, a spry and clear-eyed 84-year-old when I met him, remembers getting a scare one night in Pretoriuskloof. \"I saw these round rocks lying on the track,\" he says. \"I pulled on the brakes but it was too close. But it was a tumble weed - I heard it go \\'rrrrrr\\' as I rode over it. Nearly gave me a heart attack.\" A keen rugby player, Erasmus used his time stoking trains up the pass to stay fit. \"The trains moved so slowly,\" he says. \"When you had a rookie driver, you could throw coal on the fire, then jump off and run alongside and climb back on again. It\\'s about nine miles from Blouwater to the top of the mountain. We got so fast.\" Talla Crouse was station foreman at Bethesda Road, 20km from Letskraal, in the bitter winter of \\'65, when heavy snow all but closed the line. His job was to inspect the track every day, on foot. \"I had to walk from Lootsberg to Blouwater through the snow, to see if the trains could get through,\" he said. For six weeks that winter, Crouse lived in a tiny wood-and-iron cabin at Blouwater siding. He draped a tarpaulin over one side of the lean-to kitchen and stuffed the stove with the coal that kindly engine-men threw from their locomotives. \"I let that stove burn red-hot,\" he said. \"Even the baboons came to sit close, they were so cold.\" With those stories ringing in my head - and despite the heat - I persuaded my companions to take a drive to the top of the pass. The railway service road runs through a private farm but we had arranged a key beforehand from the farmer. With Tupac panting like a steam engine in the back, we rattled up the mountain on a steep road cut out of the hillside. From the top you can see almost all the way to Graaff-Reinet. It is an eerie place, with the wind sighing through the grass and the old sign that says \"Lootsberg\" rattling in the breeze. Not much up here but scattered sheep and the ghosts of old enginemen. We returned to the valley and took a slow drive on the dirt back roads to Nieu Bethesda, which we found somnolent in the heat. Katrin, owner of The Karoo Lamb, revived us with cold beer, tapas and good stories and it was a less melancholy crew that returned to Letskraal - Tupac providing a certain kind of air-conditioning. There we sat in the shade and listened to the windpump creak every now and then in the otherwise all enveloping quiet. Like I said: who could leave a place like this? - Ash was a guest of Letskraal Farm Accommodation STILL THERE: Letskraal\\'s longhouse, above, pretty much as Andries Pretorius left it but for the metal roof and fencing, and Tupac the German shepherd, below PAUL ASH LOOTSBERG PASS: A special train climbs the mountain one last time before the line closed for good REFUELLING STOP: The sound and smell of the internal combustion engine barely troubles visitors here\n",

      "THE RESTAURANT MARBLE, JOBURG A top chef fires up the grill to flame-cook everything from steak to sugar cane, writes INSIDE: THREE WAYS WITH DELICIOUS SEASONAL MANDARINS DAVID Higgs, formerly of Five Hundred at The Saxon and Rust en Vrede in Stellenbosch, is obviously one of South Africa\\'s best chefs, and his new restaurant, Marble, in Rosebank, Johannesburg, promises something new for \"meat and flame enthusiasts\": food cooked over fire. This is internationally trendy, but Higgs also says that he sees flame cooking as the key thing that makes South African food unique. He is a brave man if he thinks he can take on a few million self-proclaimed braai experts in the suburbs, townships and farmyards, but he has a good chance of winning because not many of them are decent cooks. Here I must confess to a blasphemy: a braai is not my idea of a good meal. Even in South African cuisine, there are a lot of more interesting things than indigestible lumps of charred meat. But Higgs is a great cook, and I was eager to be converted. Marble\\'s decor is a talking point. Pulled together from different designers and artists by Irene Kyriacou, wife of co-owner Gary Kyriacou, it is simple, spacious and modern with the occasional lavishly patterned detail. There is an expansive view across the suburbs to Northcliff, which must be even better at night. The American grill range, preparation and plating area is right there for diners to watch. It must be hot work for the chefs. The wine list is extensive enough to please anyone, and includes imported wines and spirits. The menu has meat, seafood and vegetarian options. We had oysters with spicy cucumber and crackling (R85), just two but excellent and fresh, not overwhelmed by the sauce. I had no idea what the crackling was and feared it was a bit of sea sand. The fired prawns with lime, honey and a sugar cane stick (grilled on the fire, R165), were the best of our starters, three large ones perfectly grilled with a great braai taste. It came with a \"spicy cabbage\", which was close to kimchi. My colleague loved her salted kudu (R95) with lightly pickled gherkin, a smoked soft-boiled egg and beetroot mayonnaise. It was slightly seared but raw, slightly thicker than carpaccio. For mains I had lamb cutlets with chimichurri, carrots, crisp potato skins and labneh (R265). The chops were perfectly medium as ordered, the whole dish superb. My colleague had tuna with broccoli, anchovy, grilled cucumber and coal-roasted salsa (R245). She asked if she could specify how much it should be cooked, and was told it comes as it comes. It was well done, she would have wanted it seared, but the restaurant is only in its second week and the otherwise good waiter simply got it wrong. No offence. We both really enjoyed our meals, and agreed that the side vegetables practically stole the show: all were grilled and delicious. For dessert the grilled pineapple with coconut espuma, coconut shavings, candied chilli and mint (R95) disappointed: it was hard to cut and the accompanying caramelia streusel seemed to have escaped from a granola box. My passion fruit parfait (R95) was good, the candied yuzu a surprise and the elderflower jelly just brilliant, but there was a bit too much blocked sponge cake.

      "The flame game There\\'s no limit to what can be done on a braai Recipes and styling: Callie Maritz & Mari-Louis Guy Photographs: Paul Bransby PINEAPPLE AND IRON BREW SHORT RIBS SERVES 4 Beef short ribs are very well priced and tasty, but because they are tough they are more suitable for stews than for the braai. We marinade ours in a combination of pineapple and Iron Brew to tenderise them. Iron Brew is quite unique to South Africa and its vanilla and fruity flavours work well with beef. 1.5 kg beef short ribs, halved 1 pineapple 500ml Iron Brew 2-3 garlic cloves, chopped Cube half of the pineapple. Combine the ribs, pineapple, Iron Brew and garlic in a Ziploc bag, squeeze out all the air and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but preferably longer. Remove the meat and cook over moderate to hot coals until crispy on the outside but still juicy on the bone. Cook the marinade in a small saucepan over the fire until thickened. Combine the cooked ribs with the sauce and serve with the reserved ½ pineapple. CURRIED PORK ROAST BRAAI SERVES 4 All-pork roast is by far the most budget-friendly cut. Marinated and curried it becomes a delightful braai option. About 800g-1kg piece of all-pork roast To make the marinade: 2 onions, quartered 30ml (2 tbsp) smooth apricot jam 6 fresh lemon leaves, bruised 45ml (3 tbsp) mild curry powder 15ml (1 tbsp) turmeric 5ml (1 tsp) Worcestershire sauce 65ml (¼ cup) milk 15ml (1 tbsp) brown sugar 5ml (1 tsp) ground coriander 125ml (½ cup) apple vinegar 1 small knob (2cm) root ginger, sliced 5ml (1 tsp) ground cinnamon 2 bay leaves Salt and pepper Butter lettuce & pickled vegetables: 250ml (1 cup) rice vinegar 15ml (1 tbsp) caster sugar 4 mini carrots, thinly sliced 2-3 radishes, sliced ½ head of cauliflower, broken into florets Handful of fine green beans 3-4 baby marrows, thinly sliced Combine all the marinade ingredients in a non-metallic bowl. Divide into two equal parts and refrigerate one in an airtight container. Put the rest of the marinade into a Ziploc bag with the meat, squeeze out all the air and refrigerate for 24 hours or up to 3 days. On the day of your braai, remove the meat from the bag and braai over moderate coals, turning often, until cooked but still juicy. Cook the reserved marinade in a small saucepan over the fire until thickened. Serve the pork with the curry sauce and pickled veggies. For the butter lettuce and pickled vegetables, stir the rice vinegar and caster sugar together then add the carrots, radishes, cauliflower, beans and marrows. Allow to marinade for at least an hour before serving. Pineapple and Iron Brew short ribs Curried pork roast braai\n",

      "GREEN EGGS AND MAN Tom Hancock tells about the Eastern-inspired ceramic outdoor cooker now available in South Africa A Big Green Egg is a ceramic outdoor cooker modelled on an ancient clay cooking device from the East called a kamado. American servicemen would take them home to the US from Japan during World War 2, and Ed Fisher opened the first Big Green Egg store in Atlanta in 1974. The Big Green Egg comes in all sizes and is like a kettle braai in that it consists of a lid, cooking grid, charcoal grid, lower chamber, venting system and legs, but a Big Green Egg is infinitely versatile - it can grill like a normal braai or slow-roast for 15 hours. It is a smoker and can bake anything you would bake in a normal convection oven. Charcoal (never briquettes) is placed in the ceramic firebox in the base of the egg and lit with one eco-firelighter. The lid is left open for about 10 minutes to ensure airflow, then closed and the vents adjusted to achieve the desired temperature - from 60°C for low-and-slow to over 400°C for a quick sear. The Big Green Egg\\'s ceramic design allows for precise temperature control, durability, cooking versatility, safety and convenience. For a quick meal with last-minute guests, my choice would be thick-cut sirloin, two minutes a side at 400°C for perfect medium-rare, with a chilli-garlic butter sauce. One of our favourite family-and-friends occasions is pizza night. It\\'s all hands on deck to make your own. I do the baking four minutes per pizza at 325°C. It is also great for the \"less sexy\" cuts of meat (brisket, pork butt) cooked very low and slow for many hours. We recently hosted an event where the chef smoked chocolate cheesecake in the egg. A variety of accessories are available, from pizza tools to thermometers, different grid types and wood chips. My favourite is the dual probe thermometer, which helps me get the internal temperature of whatever I\\'m cooking just right - from a distance of up to 90m. The egg uses less charcoal than most other cookers and you can re-light unused charcoal the next time you cook. We recommend Big Green Egg all natural lump charcoal, made from waste wood from the paper industry, which burns hotter and longer and produces less ash. The egg has a lifetime warranty on the ceramic construction: the internal ceramics are essentially self-cleaning with any excess fat burning off at high temperatures. The stainless-steel grid fits most dishwashers. Every so often, you scrape out any ash build-up from the base with the supplied ash tool to maintain the optimal airflow. Some of the world\\'s top restaurants, such as Noma in Copenhagen, use the Big Green Egg in their commercial kitchens. In South Africa, we count Reuben Riffel, Margot Janse, Bertus Basson and Marthinus Ferreira as Eggheads. If you are catering for a crowd on Heritage Day, the lesser-known cuts of meat, such as beef brisket and pork shoulder, are more economical and becoming very popular. Cooked low and slow with maybe a few smoking chips thrown amongst the coal is the perfect way to get your meat fix for a crowd. Priced between R7500 and R70000.

      "Fearful kakophony drowns business voice The corporate world is afraid to unite against the presidential road to ruin, writes Civil society, the opposition, the media and now the courts have found their voices to counter the misgovernance \\'WHO do I call when I want to speak to Europe?\" Apparently, Henry Kissinger never uttered this great quip attributed to him, on the impossibility of receiving a coherent and unified response from the EU. But the line is useful shorthand right now, with local substitution, to frame the same question for South Africa\\'s business community in our year of national economic peril. Perhaps some were burnt by the experience of Tony Trahar, CEO of Anglo American. In September 2004, he offered the unremarkable observation: \"I think the South African political-risk issue is starting to diminish - although I am not saying it has gone.\" Our very thin-skinned president of the time, Thabo Mbeki, responded with an outpouring of angry resentment in his weekly newsletter: \"Was Anglo now saying that democratic South Africa presents the business world ... with a higher political risk than did apartheid South Africa?\" Of course, back then we were a different country - with an economically competent though irascible head of state presiding over four times the near zero growth rate of current times. And Anglo still bestrode the economy as a colossus, although its primary listing had moved by then from Johannesburg to London. Anglo\\'s fall from a great height has mirrored the decline of the mining sector, although in recent weeks two outlier mining chiefs have found their voices in calling for the head of the politician who has driven our economy into a ditch. First, there was the recent funeral oration of AngloGold Ashanti chairman Sipho Pityana, who did not hide his disdain for President Jacob Zuma, describing him as a \"man of no integrity\" and calling for him to resign. Perhaps Pityana\\'s pigment and prominent membership of the ANC provides him with some insulation from the usual counterattacks on \"white monopoly capital\". Less insulated, although he has populated his board with some ANC eminences, is Sibanye Gold CEO Neal Froneman. This week, from Denver, Colorado, he also declared that \"Zuma has to go\", given the deterrent effect his poor governance was having on both the investor and ratings climates here. But it\\'s not at all clear whether, to adapt an old mining phrase, these two canaries in the coal mine are brave, maverick warning voices or indicative of a wave of public pronouncements to follow. Don\\'t hold your breath on business being bold. While civil society, the political opposition, the media and now the courts have found their voices and postures to counter the misgovernance which is capsizing the ship of state, this does not hold for organised business. It either goes along to get along, or simply cannot define its position in the public space. For example, a few weeks ago, Business Leadership South Africa, the group whose name suggests it is the pre-eminent voice of the private sector, published an advertisement of such diplomatic politeness at a moment of economic meltdown that it is a wonder they bothered to put their heads above the parapet at all. At the height of the Hawks assault on Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and the National Treasury and the total inaction of the president to interdict this and get a grip on his own government, BLSA offered a bromide, not a well-aimed bazooka. True, it called the Hawks\\' investigation lacking any \"legitimacy or credibility\" and referred to the \"insidious\" subversion of the national collective effort on avoiding a ratings downgrade. But it went on to laud the \"unity and progress we have achieved since December\". One wonders whether this impressive \"unity and progress since December\" includes the Constitutional Court\\'s damning judgment in March on the president violating his oath of office, or the addition in this period of more than 300000 people to the ranks of the unemployed? Either this is a new example of the \"quiet diplomacy\" that was the excuse for temporising with the tyranny of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, or, perhaps, it is the application of the old adage from Dale Carnegie. In his 1936 bestseller, still in print 30million copies later, How to Win Friends and Influence People, the self-help guru suggested readers should \"praise by name, criticise by category\". But the \"December\" reference is exquisite politesse for the reckless act of Zuma in firing Nhlanhla Nene for dishonest reasons and wreaking billions of rands in damage on our equities and bonds, at inestimable cost to our sovereign status. Since it is well-nigh impossible to separate the category of governance from the outsize powers of the president and his wrecking ball, it is time perhaps to call things for what they are. Still, the elisions of BLSA are nothing compared to the lateral arabesque recently performed by Old Mutual and its offshoot, Futuregrowth. Financial Mail editor Rob Rose called the group \"gutless\" and \"lily-livered\". First it announced it was freezing lending to state-owned companies, many of which have become nothing more than sites of spectacular misgovernance and feeding troughs for the \"schemers, skimmers, middlemen and rentiers\" who populate some of their boards. No matter the merits of this call, Futuregrowth chief investment officer Andrew Canter was obliged to apologise and recant for what his boss, Old Mutual CEO Dave Macready, called an \"unfortunate and regrettable\" statement. Of course, Macready and Co had been given the \"big bamboozala\" treatment by then. They were slammed as \"anti-transformation\" and \"stooges of white capital\". The capitulation followed in short order. All this is reminiscent of the Woody Allen movie Annie Hall. He is desperately trying to woo Diane Keaton in the film with vacuous phrases on a first date. But what the two are really thinking of each other is conveyed in subtitles. \"Kakonomics\" is not an impolite term derived from Afrikaans. According to Tim Harford, the well-known Financial Times \"Undercover Economist\", it describes the \"economics of rottenness\". As he wrote recently, \"a true kakonomy is collusive, a tacit agreement to be mediocre at someone else\\'s expense\". Pity for us, then, that the cack-handed collusion between some in business leadership and the Presidency happens to be at the expense of South Africa.

      "Comic hero\\'s superpower: a head for business Up-and-coming property magnate has a fun way to teach entrepreneurship to youngsters Our society is telling young people to go to university and find jobs, but nobody is creating these jobs AT this rate, Andile Dube is going to be big. At just 27, he is a rising property developer, buying and fixing up hijacked buildings in inner-city Johannesburg with his 20-something partners. But unlike most landlords, Dube\\'s dreams go beyond profit. He wants to inspire poor young South Africans to become their own bosses - with a comic book. Dube has just published the first edition of Young Hustla. The comic\\'s hero is Tshepisang, a desperate Soweto kid who dodges the traps of despair and crime to become an entrepreneur. Dube convinced some of South Africa\\'s leading storytellers to make his project happen: the art work is by Loyiso Mkize of Supa Strikas fame, and the storyline is by Coal Stove Pictures, which wrote the hit dance movie Hear Me Move. \"It\\'s been an incredibly long journey of three years. I was reduced to tears when we finally went to print.\" Young Hustla was a tale of individual heroism, but the social message was urgent, said Dube. \"Our society is telling young people to go to university and find jobs, but nobody is creating these jobs. At varsity, I saw people sleeping in lecture halls to get an education and better life. But this promised land is no longer there. \"Entrepreneurship could be the key - but it\\'s not well taught. At universities and colleges, we are taught the theory, not the practice. So we\\'re trying to steer them in the right direction.\" Dube is the son of teachers, and grew up in Stanger, KwaZulu-Natal, where he cut his business teeth selling sweets to schoolmates. He came to Joburg to get a BCom degree at the University of Johannesburg, then worked briefly at Hewlett-Packard in IT sales. But his inner magnate wouldn\\'t shut up, so he and some friends formed a company to buy a Rosettenville property at a bank repo auction, raising a bond to do so. \"We made a profit from the rental from day one, and kept on buying properties. \"Nobody taught us, but you can learn these things. If you\\'re told \\'Don\\'t do X!\\', you don\\'t have to make the same mistake. Tshepisang\\'s story in Young Hustla will show readers what not to do, as well as what to do.\" Dube\\'s plan for Young Hustla is to publish a weekly online series to build a readership, which would lure sponsors and advertisers. The print version will be distributed by borrowing The Big Issue\\'s model, with street vendors making a 50% profit on each copy sold. And Dube has started workshops for aspiring entrepreneurs in Maboneng, adding practical guidance to the Young Hustla dream. In the long term, Dube envisions editions of Young Hustla elsewhere in Africa, and an animated TV series. \"I\\'ve always been a big cartoons fan. Biker Mice From Mars, Dragon Ball Z, Lucky Luke, Hulk, Spider-Man, Mighty Ducks - I can go on and on!\" He says ambitious young people can fall victim to \"Facebook Syndrome\" - the myth that great companies were created overnight. \"All you see is an IPO [initial public offering] of billions, but there was a lot of work and sleepless nights and sacrifices to get to that point. \"The entrepreneurship mindset and the business itself are two separate components. \"The mindset has to be there first. Suppose your business plan is rejected, and you say: \\'This isn\\'t for me, I\\'m giving up or going back to the corporate world.\\' That\\'s not entrepreneurship. You don\\'t do it because you want to - you do it because you need to.\" amatoc@sundaytimes.co.za LIFE ON THE EDGE: Property developer and entrepreneurship coach Andile Dube published a comic book aimed at young entrepreneurs Picture: MOELETSI MABE JUST PICTURE IT: A cartoon strip from \\'Young Hustla\\' showing Tshepisang\n",

      "ANC backs off from disciplining Pravin pals Party\\'s top structure deadlocks after summoning outspoken leaders to Luthuli House I was about to go when they said the meeting was off A PLAN by President Jacob Zuma and his allies to reprimand pro-Gordhan senior ANC leaders was scuppered when it met serious resistance from three of the party\\'s top six. The Sunday Times can today reveal that Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and his deputy, Joe Phaahla, were among those summoned to appear before the top six on Monday to answer for their public support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. But they were turned back before they reached Luthuli House amid disagreement among the six. Motsoaledi and Phaahla confirmed receiving notices to appear before the leadership. \"I was about to go when they said the meeting was off. I didn\\'t know it was to be disciplined. I was just called to meet officials,\" Motsoaledi told the Sunday Times this week. Phaahla said he did not know why he was called to Luthuli House. \"I would not venture to say what the purpose was because it did not happen. It would be speculative ...\" Insiders said that Zuma, his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, his deputy Jessie Duarte, national chairwoman Baleka Mbete and treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize deadlocked over whether the pro-Gordhan leaders should be hauled over the coals. Motsoaledi and Phaahla were among the senior ANC leaders who supported Gordhan in interviews with the Sunday Times a few days before he was due in court on Wednesday on fraud charges. Other outspoken pro-Gordhan members include Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom, Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi, ANC chief whip in parliament Jackson Mthembu and national executive committee member Enoch Godongwana. Sources said that, after a marathon meeting, the top six officials decided not to proceed with the reprimand session. The meeting, according to the insiders, agreed that individual leaders should express their displeasure about the conduct of the pro-Gordhan group and advise members to raise their views within party structures. Godongwana said he never received an invitation to a meeting with the top officials. \"I did not receive anything that says anybody who expressed support for the finance minister would be reprimanded,\" he said. Motsoaledi came under fire for telling the Sunday Times that state institutions were being used for political ends and that bringing the fraud charge against Gordhan was \"a declaration of war\". He told the Sunday Times this week he stood by his statements. The national prosecuting authority and the Hawks had lost all credibility. \"It was my fear. I was scared of law and order being sacrificed. The next time the NPA says they are charging someone, who will believe them?\" Motsoaledi said he had been concerned that law enforcement agencies would lose their integrity - and that was \"exactly what happened\". Mantashe said the top six decided to call on all ANC leaders to stop making public statements - they did not only call on people who had expressed views against current leaders. \"The issue we are dealing with is, why is it easy for leaders to howl at each other in public?\" They decided that if they called Mthembu, Motsoaledi and Phaahla to order, they would also have to call out Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association leader Kebby Maphatsoe and ANC Youth League president Collen Maine. hunterq@sundaytimes.co.za CREDIBILITY: Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi SPECULATIVE: Deputy Health Minister Joe Phaahla\n",

      "Everyone \\'knew\\' them -- but who really were this mom and child? A local designer needs your help to find out about a piece of much-loved household art, writes When you look at \\'Mother and Child\\' there\\'s something very serene about it, there\\'s something very powerful about it THEY were considered family and watched over many a meal, smiling at the guests and listening to conversations about school and work, family tiffs and celebrations. But no one knows their names. They are the mother and child in the portrait that hung on the wall in many black South African households in the 1970s and \\'80s. Mother and Child, The Crying Child, The Twins, The Afro: these were the prints that graced township homes, salons, clinics. The Mother and Child photograph was so familiar that some thought - and still think - it was a portrait of themselves or a sibling and their own mother. \"I honestly thought that was my mom and my sister and I\\'m not alone,\" said voice-over artist and filmmaker Kuhle Nkosi. He recalls the portrait being sold at markets alongside amakipkip, and hanging in hair salons. \"These pictures are things that, as black folks, we grew up with. It resonates with quintessential hoodlife,\" said Nkosi. Said rapper JR: \"Everybody from Pretoria and Soweto and in Cape Town and Durban all know the significance of the picture because it resembles a household, it resembles a home.\" He said it resonated so strongly with black South Africans because \"it could be the first picture that black people actually saw that was properly taken and wasn\\'t of people running or ducking or burning stuff\". \"It was the first organically beautiful picture of a mother and child who happened to be black,\" said JR. Acclaimed photographer Peter Magubane agreed: \"It is a beautiful picture. It reminds me that black is indeed beautiful.\" In this era Drum magazine was already celebrating the beauty of Africans and The World newspaper was another platform for striking social imagery despite the dominance of a Western ideal of beauty featuring glamorous celebrities. People also took their own intimate and family portraits at home which were collected in albums and treasured. The mother and child image was popular in the way that most Christian homes had pictures of Jesus or the Last Supper on their walls. Nkosi said the portrait had appealed to strongly to black South Africans during apartheid because its power countered the mass oppression of the time. It defied the stereotype of black families perpetuated by the National Party government. \"When you look at Mother and Child there\\'s something very serene about it, there\\'s something very powerful about it as well, that I think on a subconscious level spoke to people and gave them hope.\" Osmic Menoe, founder of Johannesburg\\'s Back to the City festival, said the picture captured childhood innocence: \"It\\'s a young black female, smiling - the kid is happy being carried over the shoulder and that is a thing that every black kid and mother resonates with - we all got carried. Whether it was in the front or back, we all got carried. So it\\'s that representation of that picture.\" For musician HHP, the picture brings back memories of the LP covers of his dad\\'s favourite music, the smell of coffee at his grandmother\\'s house, school holidays. \"It takes me back to the very things that make us South African,\" said HHP - even though he is one of those who believe the origins of the picture lie outside the country. \"A lot of the people back then were perming their hair or they had it kind of natural ... and the hair I saw on this lady instantly said \\'this can\\'t be South African\\',\" he said. South Africans, though, took ownership of the photograph - and now they want to know more about it. On Thursday, local fashion house Butan Wear and an online retailer will launch a social media campaign - #SearchingForMotherAndChild - to find the photographer and the subjects of the image. The founder of the fashion house, Julian Kubel, was introduced to the image by his flatmate, Nkosi, and was immediately fascinated. \"What was most intriguing to me was the mystery that surrounds this picture. Everyone recognised the image but nobody could tell me where it originated from nor could they say anything about the identity of the mother and child.\" Kubel also teamed up with the online store to produce a mini-documentary on the portrait and market the T-shirt design bearing the image. For media personality and publicist Lerato Sengadi, the portrait is no less than \"a badge of blackness\". \"My neighbours, my cousins, the spaza - everybody had this picture,\" she said. It reminds her of the sights and the smells of her childhood: Soweto winter Sunday evenings with the pervasive orange haze from coal stoves and the rush to get home before the street lights went on. Like many others, she assumed that the photograph depicted family members, and later came to believe the mother and child were in fact herself and her mother. Photographer James Oatway commented: \"Aesthetic strengths lie in the small details - the woman\\'s eyeliner, the bracelet on the child. Clues that they are not necessarily poor or \\'suffering\\'.\" He said the image had thrived in the 1970s and \\'80s despite the absence of social media because of its profound themes of \"pride, love and beauty\" and its depiction of the nurturing maternal relationship. \"These themes become even more important given the context of an apartheid South Africa ... when the system was intent on dehumanising black Africans and breaking down their values.\" He also attributed the portrait\\'s popularity to its emotive quality: \"Often the power of an image lies not in the actual content but in the emotions that the image makes the viewer feel.\" These were among the considerations that, along with the enduring mystery behind the image, persuaded Kubel to immortalise it in a T-shirt design. \"This project isn\\'t just about the picture and finding the mother and child. It is about a lot more,\" he said. \"It is about black identity, the bond of a family and a people, and furthermore it highlights the beauty that manages to thrive despite oppression and poverty.\" INNOCENCE: Graffiti artist and BTTC festival founder Osmic Menoe has the picture on his wall HOPE: Kuhle Nkosi wears the Butan Wear T-shirt with the mystery mother and child Pictures: DEWALD BRAND\n",

      "As the government goes rogue, court steps in to save the day SOCIAL Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini should consider herself lucky to have been let off relatively lightly by the Constitutional Court. Sure, she got a spanking from the eminences who described her conduct as incomprehensible and reprehensible. She may yet pay the legal costs from her own pocket. But she escaped a more serious indictment. She could have been had for contempt of court. The saga was not merely a dereliction of duty, it was an open defiance of a judgment by the highest court. It\\'s almost as if she regards herself as being above the law. She could, and should, have been dragged in front of the court to explain her conduct. One could see even as judgment was passed that the justices have been left befuddled by her behaviour. Only she could have enlightened them. She could also have been rapped over the knuckles for her failure to meet Tuesday\\'s deadline to answer questions sent by the court. Asked why the deadline was not met, her lawyer said something to the effect of: \"Well these things happen. We\\'ll ask for the court\\'s condonation.\" One can almost sense the court\\'s reluctance to involve itself in a fight with the government. But it is being dragged into one by the wilful incompetence of President Jacob Zuma and his administration. The conditions of the judgment mean the Constitutional Court will be babysitting a government department. That\\'s an indictment. It means the court cannot trust the government to do the right thing. But don\\'t expect Zuma or Dlamini to feel embarrassed. They\\'re shameless. In fact, the government\\'s delinquent behaviour is sucking the judiciary more and more into the political arena. As the Constitutional Court was handing down its judgment on Friday, the High Court in Pretoria was declaring the appointment of Berning Ntlemeza, head of the Hawks, invalid; and the Prasa board was contesting its summary dismissal by Transport Minister Dipuo Peters. These are actions of a government that has gone rogue. It\\'s left to the judiciary to preserve our sanity. The grants matter should not have been allowed to come to this point. The penetrating questions posed by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to Dlamini\\'s legal representative this week should have been the sort of inquiry that she should have been subjected to by Zuma and his cabinet. Why was this tender so shoddily handled and why had nothing been done in two years to remedy the situation? Dlamini should have been hauled over the coals, or fired, after the Constitutional Court\\'s judgment declaring the Cash Paymaster Services contract invalid. Zuma neither asked such questions nor acted against her. He turned out to be Dlamini\\'s chief apologist, pleading with the country to calm down. Maybe Dlamini is not the kingpin in this matter, but a mere courier. The buck stops with Zuma. The involvement of his trusted lieutenants - South African Revenue Service commissioner Tom Moyane and Michael Hulley, his trusted attorney - in awarding the contract to CPS, means Zuma may not be a disinterested bystander. There is a lot that still needs to be revealed. For instance why CPS, lacking BEE credentials, was able to win such a lucrative government contract. It seems proponents of radical economic transformation were asleep at the switch. Payment of social grants is a huge state responsibility - second only to the economy and safety and security - especially given the extent of poverty and destitution in the country. Recipients also happen to be a loyal ANC constituency, often referred to as \"our people\". It\\'s surprising therefore to see an ANC government handling an issue of life and death for its constituency with such disdain and ham-handedness. Ironically, it was the Black Sash, an organisation often dismissed in ANC circles as a bunch of liberals, that came to the rescue - defending the rights of mainly poor black recipients against the incompetence and dereliction of duty by a black government. ANC members who turned up in court were not there to express common cause with the poor, but to support Dlamini, the villain of the piece. Others were at the airport to welcome Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma back from Addis Ababa where her campaign to be president of South Africa has been headquartered for the past four years. It\\'s as if she\\'s never been away from home. Dlamini-Zuma is no stranger to scandal, having been involved in the Sarafina debacle in the first ANC government. Corruption, it seems, is a prerequisite for higher office. Zuma\\'s record is well known. Dlamini is a convicted fraudster, found guilty in the Travelgate saga. That wasn\\'t a bar to promotion. She\\'s now in charge of a department with a budget worth billions - and she\\'s making a mighty hash of things. Thanks to the Constitutional Court, the old, the sick and infirm will receive their pitiful handouts. But one is left with a feeling that the miscreants have almost got off scot-free.\n",

      "When Dutch physician Hugo Templeman asked a choir in a Limpopo village to sing, naively thinking it would do the self-esteem of its young members some good, little could he know he was setting them and their community on the road to world conquest, writes The dusty road that led to a Hollywood dream It takes a village to raise a choir I was very excited and happy to see that they were doing so well in America ... I feel that this is good for the community Necklaces in geometric orange, yellow, turquoise and other bold colours lie stacked on the kitchen table among plates piled with beads. The room itself is a stark contrast to all the colour - the plastered walls are bare, the concrete floor is cold. The cast-iron stove is fired by coal. The beads wobble as if keeping time as the gogos around the table start ululating, \"ngijabula kakhulu\". The Zulu phrase, which means I am happy, echoes beyond the walls of Sarah Nhlapho\\'s home in Moutse village in Limpopo. She is one of the five \"Gutsy Gogos\" who have been creating beaded pieces for the Ndlovu Youth Choir, the singing sensations who this week compete in the finals of the world\\'s biggest talent show, America\\'s Got Talent. \"I\\'ve never been overseas, but my work has made it overseas and that makes me very proud, ngijabula kakhulu, ngijabula kakhulu,\"Nhlapho sings as the other women join in chorus, all beaming with joy. The choir\\'s Zulu rendition of Ed Sheeran\\'s Shape of You went viral on YouTube. Accompanied by Grammy-winning South African flautist Wouter Kellerman it reached more than a million viewers in a week. The hype around the choir went stratospheric after the America\\'s Got Talent producers contacted them to audition in March, when they got a standing ovation. Even Simon Cowell, who has made his name as the show\\'s Mr Nasty, has given them the thumbs up. The enterprising Moutse gogos now earn an income creating bead pieces for the choir. Nhlapho explains that the skill of beadworking is passed on from mothers to daughters. The group of women, made up of Nhlapho, Maria Mahlangu, Elizabeth Makua, Betty Mahlangu and Elizabeth Mahlangu, officially got together as the Gutsy Gogos in 2003. \"As a young girl I watched my mother do this and she watched her mother do this. We get inspiration from each other because we all have a different way of doing things and we also look around on the internet to see what the latest trends are,\" says Nhlapho. It takes three days to make a beaded headband, a necklace, a bracelet and a beaded belt for each member of the choir. For the choir\\'s first audition, the gogos woke up at 4am and only went to bed at midnight. Then there\\'s the mission to buy beads, which involves a four-hour trip to Marabastad in Pretoria. \"Everyone is proud and everyone is talking about the kids, they\\'ve made this place known. As adults we\\'ve never been oversees, so to see our children make it oversees makes us very proud,\" says Nhlapho. Since they came to the attention of the world the choir has been inundated with requests for interviews. Thulisile Masanabo says she was bullied as a child for being too skinny and was so shy at first that she stood at the back of the choir. \"For most of the choristers, we come from underprivileged families, so joining the choir for us is not just about singing but a place where we come to escape our problems, where everyone is seen as one, and you can never judge anyone for their background,\" she told a radio talk-show host. Thulisile remembers her first encounter with the choir. \"I was on my way from school and they were having auditions. They would just come out and call everyone in to audition - even if you couldn\\'t sing, just to take a chance.\" The African proverb, \"It takes a village to raise a child\", rings true in Moutse, typical of the nondescript dusty villages with sand roads and modest homes that are dotted across SA\\'s northern regions. The only geographical feature that distinguishes this from countless other villages is the mountains in the distance. Seamstress Linah Ncongwane is another local who has participated in the choir\\'s success. She created the skirts and shirts which the choir wore in the famous YouTube video that went viral. One must negotiate several dirt roads to get to Ncongwane\\'s house, where The Moment, by jazz saxophonist Kenny G, is playing on the radio in her living room. On another table are material off-cuts, an Italian dressmaking book, needles and three sewing machines. The soft-spoken dressmaker shows us the patterns she used to make the choir\\'s skirts and shirts. Sewing patterns can be bought but Ncongwane has used old newspapers for her patterns. She did needlework at school and started sewing by hand to make ends meet. It wasn\\'t until her late husband encouraged her to enrol at the local dressmaking school that she studied the craft properly. She has been dressing the choir for about three years. Ncongwane started making curtains and bedding for the Ndlovu Care Group before she was approached to make outfits for the choir. \"I was very excited and happy to see that they were doing so well in America and that my work was getting recognition. I feel that this is good for the community. I thank God for bringing Dr Templeman here; if it were not for him our work would never get the recognition it\\'s getting now.\" Hugo Templeman is a familiar face in Moutse. The Dutch physician started the Ndlovu Care Group in the 1990s. The project initially started as a clinic and has since grown to include child and youth development programmes, infrastructure support and a research centre. In 2008 the Ndlovu Miracle Theatre in nearby Elandsdoorn was opened; Templeman decided a group of local singers should perform at the opening. \"Kids come in slouching. When they start to sing the first thing they have to do is stand upright. They start singing and what do you do at the end? You applaud. For the first time in their life they\\'re applauded, there\\'s a major change,\" Templeman said. It was conductor Ralf Schmitt\\'s idea to try something different and do a local version of Ed Sheeran\\'s Shape of You that changed everything. Schmitt drives the two hours from Johannesburg twice a week to rehearse with the choir. The song\\'s publishers gave Schmitt the go-ahead. He came up with a few new lines which he brainstormed with 24-year-old Sandile Majola. \"I used some kasi slang to make it catchy so young people could relate to it, especially in the townships,\" says Majola. Moutse village is a time capsule of pre-1994 SA with its air of abandonment and neglect. There are still pit latrines and children push wheelbarrows with empty water buckets en route to fetch water from boreholes built by Templeman. Goats and chickens run around and cows graze on sparse clumps of grass. Some of the choir members come from single-parent homes and others are orphans and the money they earn singing feeds the family. Though the choir officially has 48 members, only 24 were chosen to go to the US. Those left behind feel no bitterness, however, only pride. Grade 10 pupil Mbali Tshangna sits in an empty classroom before her next maths test. The 17-year-old says singing was initially just something to keep her off the streets and busy, but now she sees it as an opportunity to pursue her dream. \"I feel very proud, especially because we are from Limpopo, it\\'s a very downtrodden community. The choir has taken us very high ... we speak every day and they\\'ve been bragging to us about walking the streets of Hollywood.\" Fourteen-year-old Gugulethu Mahlangu has become something of a celebrity in the community now that the choir has achieved international attention. \"When people saw the auditions they called me and said, \\'We love you guys, we\\'re your fans\\'. Everyone was all around me and people were calling me.\" Elizabeth Mahlangu of the Gutsy Gogos has the last word: \"If they win, everyone wins. We are all Ndlovu.\" The choir will compete against nine other acts this week. The live final will air in the US on September 17 and 18, and the winning act will walk away with $1m and chance to headline a show at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas KICKER HERE The Ndlovu Youth Choir, led by conductor Ralf Schmitt, were stunned when they wowed the judges and made the semifinals of \\'America\\'s Got Talent\\'. No less stunning were the costumes and beadwork they wore, all of which were made by members of their community in Moutse village in Limpopo.

      "SEEK OUT THE OVERLOOKED STRANGENESS The SA novelist likes to keep her travels as fantastical & noir as her stories Author The first holiday I remember as a child was going to Umngazi River Bungalows in the Eastern Cape, running wild round the grounds, golden beaches and wilderness, and Santa water-skiing across the lagoon to bring us our presents. It had its perils too. My dad stood on a scorpion fish and was deathly ill. The first time I went abroad, I was five, my brother was three, and my mom decided to use the insurance money from a break-in to take us to the US. She figured travel and adventure were worth more than jewellery. We did New York and a side trip to Rio, and explored a series of theme parks, Six Flags Over Georgia and Disney World in Florida. But the ones that stuck with me were seeing mermaids at Weeki Wachee Springs State Park in Florida and the shark tunnel at Sea World, which haunted my dreams for decades. That\\'s the trip where I picked up my \"international bastard\" mid-Atlantic accent. The most remote place I\\'ve ever been to is Antarctica. It had been a life-long dream and in March I tagged along with some academic friends who were going to a conference in Ushuaia, Argentina, and had arranged a trip to the peninsula. It was hella expensive - $9,000 (R136,200) to share a two-bedroom berth on a 100-passenger ship for nine days - but so worth every cent, every second. After two days roiling across the Drake Passage, I cried when I stepped out on deck to see this landscape of white mountains sunk into the coal-black sea with vivid slashes of blue ice. We had two expeditions a day from the ship and our first time out we were surrounded by gently interested humpback whales, and a leopard seal who was more aggressively curious, damaging three of the zodiacs badly enough that they had to be sent back to the ship. We crossed slushy seas, hiked up snowy atolls, made way for penguins on the penguin highway and walked moonscape stony beaches under the glare of fat fur seals. It was incredible. I want to go back. My favourite city in SA is Johannesburg. I grew up there, so it\\'s home in that deep, tangled-roots-into-my-heart way. I love the friendliness of the people, the sense of hustle, the energy and interconnectedness. I tried to get at some of this in my book Zoo City (which, by the way, is celebrating its 10th anniversary next year), which is the best answer I can give to this question. When it comes to favourite hotels in SA, I generally prefer Airbnbs or staying with friends, but my 11-year-old daughter Keitu and I recently had an amazing stay at Nedile Lodge in the Welgevonden Reserve in Limpopo, pictured. We sat for an hour amongst a herd of female elephants gently flowing past the Land Rover, saw cheetahs chasing cheeky jackals, and had two bull elephants come to visit the pool, drinking water and indulging in some poolside snacks (ie yanking branches down from the trees). I Iive in Cape Town, where the tourism highlights are well known. If I was hosting a tourist here, I\\'d take them to my favourite local shop for local people, The Book Lounge, for a book launch, followed by mac-and-cheese and a show at the voluptuously kitschy and queer The Raptor Room. I\\'d also take them to Green Point Urban Park, which is my favourite non-wild green space in the city or rent bicycles from the prom and go for a ride alongside the ocean. My favourite international city is Berlin - for all the usual reasons. It feels vital, queer and arty, especially areas like Kreuzberg or Neukölln and it\\'s also a city that has done some heavy reckoning with its past. The dark history is present, acknowledged, exposed to the light. But mainly because you can cycle everywhere. I\\'ve been lucky to stay in a couple of ridiculously luxurious hotels. The most memorable was probably The Chedi in Muscat, sharing a bed so it was actually affordable with my artist/writer/filmmaker friend Sophia Al Maria. My oddest travel experience was probably eloping to Certaldo Alto, a Medieval walled town in Italy with my now ex-husband Matthew, to have horror-movie music waft down from the balconies of the historic courtyard in the middle of our vows. We explored the upper levels after the ceremony to find an amazing contemporary art exhibition of remixed fairytales, from a very creepy Little Red Riding Hood statue to a scratchy animated video that was a re-telling of the Beauty and the Beast myth, using King Kong. It turned out that that was the origin of the creepy organ music - it was perfect. I am mostly an adventurous eater when I travel. I love strange combinations of flavours, local markets, small holes in the wall that only locals know about. I\\'m not down with organ meat or insects and arachnids that still resemble their form. I\\'d be happy to try a bug burger, but there\\'s no way I\\'m crunching down on deep-fried tarantula. My best piece of travel advice is to always check Atlas Obscura (atlasobscura.com) for the overlooked strangenesses of a place. It\\'s how we discovered Murphy\\'s Ranch, pictured below, an actual Nazi encampment from the 1940s, abandoned and graffitied in the hills of Santa Monica that you can hike down to, and the Monster Kabinett in Berlin where an artist leads you on an expedition through a carnival of lurching, clunking, steampunk beasts. Some day, I\\'d really like to see Tokyo, to take in the pop culture and food and history. I love the literature, from Banana Yoshimoto to Haruki Murakami. I love Takashi Murakami\\'s art, Takashi Miike\\'s movies. And, of course, my daughter has grown up on Hayao Miyazaki\\'s films, from Ponyo to Spirited Away, so we would definitely stop at the Ghibli Museum, which showcases his fantastical creations.

      "Rajen Reddy: A tireless entrepreneur 1962-2021 Rajen Reddy, who has died in Durban at the age of 58, was an obsessive entrepreneur who rented an abandoned petrol station and became one of the country\\'s leading oil barons. He started KZN Oils in 1998 after persuading Total to supply him with four drums of oil, which he filled himself and sold to Transnet\\'s Durban port operation. Today, KZN Oils plays a key role in the logistics, sales and marketing of petroleum-related products in SA. Clients include Transnet, Anglo American and De Beers. A major marketer and distributor of fuel for Chevron/Caltex, it has a fleet of eight tankers, owns or manages 36 service stations, pumps 200Ml of fuel a year and has an annual turnover of more than R2bn. In addition to KZN Oils, he started a string of other companies including Ko-lay, which supplies flame-grilled chicken to Caltex FreshStop outlets; satellite connectivity and telecommunications company JD Telecom; Champion Health Care, which manufacturers surgical dressings; and a property portfolio of 65 properties including the Howick Falls Hotel. He housed them in the RR Group, of which he was executive chair. Reddy was born in Durban on May 9 1962. After matriculating at Clairwood High School, he joined his father\\'s plumbing business in Howick and later started his own plumbing and construction business in Durban. While getting supplies one day in 1988, he drove past a Shell service station where they were removing fuel tanks. He made inquiries and was told it was closing down and the site had been expropriated by the local municipality. It had always been his dream to own a service station, and he begged an unsympathetic municipal official - \"I literally grovelled\", he said in an interview - to rent it to him for R1,200, which he had to borrow from his sceptical father-in-law. For years, getting finance from the banks was mission impossible. He found they didn\\'t look kindly on people like him who had \"passion and dreams\" but little by way of a business plan. He rented out the lubrication bay, workshop and everything else he could to generate enough working capital to run the forecourt until he\\'d grown the business enough to take over the whole operation and make it profitable. His relationship with banks improved, and, in 1996, a banker told him about new opportunities coming up for black business people to supply oil to Durban port through Transnet as part of a government programme to open up the fuel industry. Reddy freely admitted that without BEE he probably wouldn\\'t have made it. He found that the oil selling business was an old boys\\' club. \"It was very rigid, no red carpet was rolled for people like me. I found it very tough trying to break in there.\" There were high barriers to entry, starting with the extension of credit. Without government support it would have been almost impossible, he said. The government took some of the business it was doing with the oil majors and channelled it to black empowerment players. A government official accompanied him to his first meeting with oil company executives who were asked to supply a certain volume of their goods in the name of BEE so that he could sell to the Transnet port operations. \"They looked at you with squint eyes because it\\'s their business and now you\\'re muscling in, you want a piece of the action,\" Reddy said in an interview. \"It didn\\'t go down very well.\" He realised that without a supply deal from one of the fuel majors he would not get the port contract. And without a port contract nobody would supply him. He was sent from pillar to post, even travelling to Johannesburg for the first time in his life to meet an oil company executive. While trying to organise his first deal he started a stationery business, although he knew nothing about stationery. \"It\\'s amazing what you will do when you want to survive,\" he said. His first month\\'s turnover was R982. His profit was R92. He was determined to break into the oil supply business and eventually got a call from a port buyer offering him a contract to supply lubricants. With contract in hand, he went to Total, which, in exchange for cash that he had to borrow very quickly, finally agreed to supply him with four barrels\\' worth. That was January 2 1998, a date he never forgot. It was the date he started KZN Oils. Reddy was obsessive about business. Sleepless nights were part of his life. Luckily, he only needed three or four hours\\' sleep. The rest of the time, seven days a week, he ran his businesses. He said the key to success as an entrepreneur was to understand what you were doing, what you wanted to do, how you wanted to do it, and then follow it through. There was no excuse not to be on the ground with all your businesses and in touch all the time, he said. His greatest influence was his grandfather, who was an entrepreneur in construction, wood and coal. As a child, he watched him closely and observed how he insisted on regular and thorough report-backs from those running his businesses. Reddy followed his example. Although he said he didn\\'t have a ruthless side, he was known to be a hard taskmaster. \"I want things done yesterday, I only demand 110%,\" he said. He was driven by the threat of poverty even after becoming extremely wealthy. It kept his ego in check and his feet on the ground, he said. It was important for an entrepreneur never to forget that poverty could happen at any time. Reddy, who died of a heart condition after being in intensive care for a month, is survived by Esay, his wife of 37 years whom he met at school, a daughter and two sons. - Rajen Reddy, who broke into the old boys\\' club of the oil business.\n",

      "Cops have not learnt Wits killing highlights urgency of public order police training Policing experts and unions are sounding the alarm over the apparent failure of South African Police Service (SAPS) management to properly implement the Marikana commission of inquiry\\'s recommendations to train officers in dealing with public violence. CCTV footage shows public order police indiscriminately firing at close range into crowds of protesting Wits University students in Johannesburg this week. A bystander, Mthokozisi Ntumba, was killed in the gunfire, and several students were wounded. Police minister Bheki Cele has also been sharply criticised for sitting on a report by international and national experts which provides strategic guidance on how to deal with various policing challenges. Both the SAPS and Cele\\'s office have dismissed the accusations. Marikana commission chair judge Ian Farlam called for the establishment of the panel of experts, which gave its report to Cele in 2018. The panel\\'s deputy chair, Eldred de Klerk, said Cele had sat on their report and its recommendations for two years. \"The report was to give the police ministry strategic direction to transform and professionalise the SAPS,\" said De Klerk. \"Even though SAPS were part of the panel, there seems to be very little institutional movement or commitment to learn from Marikana or other fatal protest shootings with a lack of policy and strategic direction.\" De Klerk said the police portfolio committee needed to be hauled over the coals for not demanding the report\\'s release. He added that as long as transformation and implementation of strategies did not happen there would be future Ntumba killings. Sean Tait, African Policing Civilian Oversight Forum director, said there were cracks in the SAPS public order policing system. \"There is hardly any coherence. Policies and instructions are not filtering down to officers on the ground. What happened in Braamfontein demonstrates this. None of the critical lessons from the 2016 Fees Must Fall protests on how to deal with demonstrations have been passed on to members.\" Tait said rubber bullets could be lethal. \"Firing rubber bullets must be based on the principles of necessity, proportionality and on precaution. These principles were violated this week. \"Within Gauteng, and in particular Johannesburg, public order policing members have not got the message, unlike those in the Free State, who, during the 2020 Senekal protests, demonstrated restraint in a highly volatile situation. In Gauteng, this unit\\'s members, like those in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Limpopo, have a cavalier recklessness in firing rubber bullets.\" Tait said urgent training of police in the appropriate use of firearms in protests was needed. \"Indiscriminate firing is never allowed. If you are looking at dispersal, rubber bullets can only be fired if there is an imminent threat against life or property.\" He said when firing rubber bullets, policies dictated the \"skip round\" principal must be followed where rounds are fired into the ground first and not directly at a person. \"You cannot also fire a rubber bullet from close range. Given that rubber bullets can kill, there must be substantial distance between protesters and police.\" Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union spokesperson Richard Mamabola said while police management had committed to implementing the Marikana commission recommendations, getting them \"implemented so people are protected and our members are not left vulnerable to breaching the law is a major challenge\". He said that despite the police saying training, especially that of public order units, would be prioritised, it had not been, \"with refresher courses seldom occurring\". Cele\\'s spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, said the panel of experts report would be released at the end of March. \"It is not public because there were technicalities from the team dealing with the report that had to be addressed,\" he said. Police spokesperson Col Brenda Muridili said that following the Marikana commission\\'s recommendations, the SAPS crowd management learning programme was revised in 2016. \"A crowd conflict management course is in the early stages of being rolled out,\" she said. \"All public order policing training material has been revised. Platoon commanders are trained in commanding and managing their personnel and crowd management situations.\" Asked how often refresher training was done, Muridili said on an \"ad hoc\" basis. She said should any member exceed the boundaries of the law, in any situation, they would be required to account for their actions both criminally and departmentally. Former SAPS ballistics expert Wollie Wolmeraans said investigations involving rubber bullets were extremely difficult. \"Shotgun barrels, unless defective, do not leave markings, especially not on rubber bullets. To prove which gun and policeman fired the fatal round in the Ntumba case will be difficult, especially if the cartridge cannot be found.\" He said the investigation would come down to CCTV and cellphone footage, witness statements and an expert reconstruction of the crime scene. \"There must be a very careful crime scene reconstruction. For that to happen there is an urgency to secure every second of available CCTV footage and for this to be analysed in detail.\" He said for someone to die from a rubber bullet, the shooter had to be very close. Police and Wits students face off in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, on Wednesday during protests over university fees. A bystander, Mthokozisi Ntumba, was shot dead when police fired rubber bullets at close range at demonstrators. Picture: Alon Skuy\n",

      "KEEP ON BURNING A glam new eatery is re-igniting the spark in the once bustling restaurant hub in Rosebank, Johannesburg, writes PROUD MARY The Bank, 26 Cradock Ave,Rosebank, Johannesburg010-023-3316 or e-mail reservations@proudmary.co.za It takes temerity to open up a glamorous and costly dining space in the middle of a pandemic and at a time when some serious heavyweights around the country are closing their restaurant doors. But it\\'s just what the team behind Rosebank\\'s Proud Mary have done, and it seems the gamble is paying off with reservations in prime time a necessity. Owner Gary \"Gazza\" Hollywood has an impressive culinary pedigree, having been involved in the Jozi restaurant scene for the past 20 years and in partnerships with brands such as Doppio Zero, Piza E Vino, The Foundry, Streatery and most recently La Boqueria. \"With Proud Mary, our vision was to create an all-day modern eatery and wine bar specialising in small tapas plates, nostalgic café dishes, open-fire cooking and a chef\\'s experience bar,\" says Hollywood. \"We wanted to open the business in the spring of 2020 but Covid prevented that from being a reality. We took the decision that no matter what happened with restaurant and curfew restrictions, if we were allowed to trade we would open and try and make it a success. We had just put way too much effort into the project and we had the people to pull it off no matter what.\" Proud Mary is a partnership between Hollywood and the voco hotel in The Bank development in what is clearly becoming one of the trendiest spots in the city and a much-needed upgrade for Rosebank, which was in need of a serious facelift. The first South African voco hotel will be officially launched in August. It boasts 140 rooms with interiors by local designer Nkuli Nhleko and will have an extensive art gallery curated by Morne Visagie from the Art Gazette. A visual décor feast has always been important for Hollywood, who designed La Boqueria from the ground up with his then business partner. \"I love being involved in the design of my stores. With Proud Mary I worked with a good friend of mine, the interior architect Enrike de Villiers. Our vision was to create a timeless and modern mid-century dining room and bar,\" he says. Proud Mary is a sensory delight; it manages to be proud without being overbearingly loud and is both stylish and comfortable. At the centre of the interior space is a sexy and dramatic wine, cocktail and champagne bar. Walls are painted black with pops of teal plush fabrics and tones of oxblood mixed with lots of natural wood and brass. In the kitchen is chef Christo Nortier, who was mentored under Jamie Oliver at Barbacoa in London and then in the Jamie Oliver Group before his return to SA. Visiting Proud Mary, you\\'ll soon discover that the menu and dishes require more than a single sitting to fully appreciate. There\\'s a seafood raw bar as well as a variety of tapas and you\\'d do well to order a selection of small plates and share. The seabass ceviche with lime tiger\\'s milk and coriander was citrusy yet delicate (R85); the sticky pork belly with teriyaki, fresh chilli and coriander (R85) was unctuous and packed with Asian flavours; the coal-roasted broccoli with velouté and gremolata (R48) was sublime, as was the coal-fired octopus with pineapple confit and bright yellow saffron aioli (R95). We returned a second time for individual mains and weren\\'t disappointed - from the blue swimmer crab linguine in a lemon, wine and garlic sauce (R220) and a splendid sirloin (R165) with triple-fried chips and a béarnaise sauce to the wagyu burger (R145) and Proud Mary caesar (R115), a flavour bomb with yakitori chicken thighs, crispy nori and ponzu anchovy dressing. There\\'s also an array of well thought out vegetarian and vegan offerings. Angela Jordaan has put together an impressive wine list that celebrates an array of small batch, local and independent wineries. There\\'s also a wonderful cocktail menu. This is a restaurant that Joburgers can be proud of - long may she continue to burn on the dining scene. Open Monday to Sunday from 8am to 10pm Proud Mary is a sensory delight; at the centre of the interior space is a sexy and dramatic wine, cocktail and champagne bar.

      "Sanibonani, what? Finding my way back to my mother tongue Eyebrows are raised and heads shaken when , schooled in English, attempts to speak isiZulu Exchanges with petrol attendants have been my primary tool to learn conversational Zulu and graduate from Fanagalo expert to the next BW Vilakazi As I approach the age of 30, existential crises as well as moments of clarity create one very confusing melting pot of emotions. In between making decisions on whether or not to throw out my last pair of skinny jeans (because Gen Z said so) and trying to consolidate my long-delayed tax-free savings account so that I can avoid panic attacks about my future financial security, I\\'ve found time to obsess about another very important subject: language. I\\'ve always struggled with my identity in relation to it. This came to mind as I read the story of Miss SA hopeful Fikile Cele. Cele was dragged over hot coals for failing to pronounce the click in her surname and was deemed \"not Zulu enough\". If I had a penny for every time someone\\'s face has echoed that sentiment to me ... I\\'m a product of my generation. We Born Frees grew up in the burgeoning \"rainbow nation\" and had more opportunity than our predecessors to make friends across the spectrum. Growing up in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg, I had a very diverse environment in which to learn and engage with people from all walks of life. I\\'m the product of a Sotho mother and Zulu father, as my surname suggests. I have a very proud Zulu lineage with links to a little-known warrior named Shaka as well as King Cetshwayo kaMpande. As unifying and uplifting as all of this is, as a child it was hard to celebrate diversity when you were in the deeper recesses of northern KwaZulu-Natal suited up in 35°C heat enduring a four-hour church service while not being able to understand a word, though I can now grasp the majority of sermons by the venerable Rev Ngobese. I have also become quite adept at knowing when to laugh in any other language, so there are some positives to dwell on here. I often take solace in the fact that I\\'m definitely not the only one who\\'s endured these growing pains. In fact an increasing number of my peers are growing up with this detachment from their mother tongue and, in turn, their family history. It\\'s indicative of something called subtractive bilingualism. This is the phenomenon whereby individuals learn a second language at the expense of what should be their first. In a case like mine, where the mother tongue was not perfected at home, compounded by the very anglicised schools I was privileged to attend, it can lead to resentment towards your own culture. Existing in SA as a monolingual speaker has been at times a hilarious, frightening and educational experience. Among my most memorable experiences has been going to licensing departments or any government department, where a sassy official would take me to task upon seeing my ID and then shake their heads in disdain as I rattled off whatever Fanagalo I could muster. Exchanges with petrol attendants have been my primary tool to learn conversational Zulu and graduate from Fanagalo expert to the next BW Vilakazi. One of the tricks I used to employ to avoid such scrutiny was to say I went to school in England. After all, the school I attended in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands looks like Hogwarts, so it all checks out. This line was always sure to quell any further questioning of my origins. Over time I\\'ve been very grateful to get in touch with who I am and I hope the stories that have shaped my experience might also benefit another mispronouncing Gen Z deemed not Zulu or Afrikaans or Xhosa enough, and they can, in turn, accept who they really are. The bottom line is that our diversity is something to be celebrated and your first language is often at the heart of that. Contrary to popular belief, there are ways for you to connect with your culture and language even without speaking it. Fikile Cele was emboldened by the saga she endured and said it would not stop her from learning Zulu, and neither will my multiple cringe-inducing efforts with the language. I have commenced online classes and the next time I\\'m greeted with a Sawubona, kunjani? I won\\'t be responding with a faint yebo. instagram.com/zak_the_lezi_/ @zak_the_lezi PICTURE: SUPPLIED There are ways to connect with your culture and language even without speaking it, says the writer.\n",

      "Take me away to anywhere but here I want to arrive in an obscure town like Pofadder with just a rucksack on my back, armed with nothing more than my rugged good looks and sunny dispositionHumour I\\'m writing this on Wednesday July 14 2021. Today is my daughter\\'s birthday. I\\'m at my mother\\'s house in the Valley of a Thousand Hills. My daughter is hardly 15 minutes away, in Sherwood. Getting to her is a bit tricky. There are burly, hairy and exceedingly angry men blocking Old Main Road in Bothas Hill. Last night they had six or seven women lying face-first on the ground, next to a van laden with plasma televisions. All the women had been stripped naked. In freezing 5°C weather. I was told by the commanders of the roadblock that these were looting proceeds. Frankly speaking, I wanted one of those plasma TVs but, hey, I don\\'t have R20,000 lying around. And I have no reason to doubt the word of these straight-shooting, responsible citizens. They spoke very good English. As I drove down the winding road towards KwaPhothwe Hardware (or Valley Trading, as it is called now), I had an epiphany. I actually don\\'t want to be here right now. South Africa. And no, I don\\'t think there\\'s a better place to be. But borders are closed. And from what I hear, things are worse in my preferred destination within the borders of SA: Pongola on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. A few years ago I watched Disappearing Acts starring Sanaa Lathan and Wesley Snipes. I have never been so disappointed by the disparity between a movie\\'s title and its content. I was expecting a movie about a character who goes into hiding in an obscure place like Roodepoort where no sane human being chooses to live unless they are a part-time croupier at Silver Star casino and they owe a loan shark called Mishka from Bedfordview R45,000. This is the life I\\'m fantasising about during these rough times. I just want to get away from everyone for a while. I want to arrive in an obscure town like Pofadder with just a rucksack on my back, armed with nothing more than my rugged good looks and sunny disposition. I want to rent a room above a pool bar, descending only in the evenings to consort with women of dubious moral character and drink copious amounts of Carling Black Label. I want to tap into my meagre knowledge of microbiology to start a business distilling a mampoer that is notorious from Upington to Springbok. But mostly, I just don\\'t want to field phone calls from media houses trying to get me to comment about why folks are taking couches from Makro and driving Hyster forklifts down the Malandela Road in KwaMashu. I like to believe that I\\'m an informed human being but I honestly cannot pronounce intelligently on why ostensibly intelligent chartered accounts are braving the icy cold elements in Hillcrest, armed with golf clubs and shrivelled up totermans. After all, if the \"marauding hordes\" decide that they need access to the Koo beans, Kleenex tissues and HTH chlorine stockpiles in your garage, they will take them one way or the other. The trick is to figure out why \"they\" are \"running amok\" and deal with that. A friend of mine who would like to remain anonymous told me a beautiful story about the art of disappearing from the face of the Earth. Apparently, when things got really rough in Johannesburg townships in the aftermath of the 1976 uprising, one of his grandfathers went missing. He left Thembisa township on a random Tuesday morning and just never returned home in the evening. At first, everyone assumed he was at his concubine\\'s place in Alexandra. Around the time Orlando Pirates won the Mainstay Cup final against Moroka Swallows in 1980, four years later, it became clear that he was probably not coming back. But everyone was wrong about that, because 27 years later, in 2003, he actually did find his way back home. He rocked up on a Wednesday afternoon, complaining about the unreliable Metrorail service. He walked into the house, greeted everyone gathered around the Welcome Dover coal stove in the kitchen, went to \"his\" bedroom, lay on the bed and inquired why no-one had heated water for him to take a bath. At this point in the story I would like to remind you, dear reader, that this was 27 years later. The more arithmetically astute will be able to calculate how many years ago 2003 was because of a fascinating fact: in this entire time, no family member has been able to pluck up the courage to ask him why he came back with one leg missing. And I don\\'t think it\\'s safe to insist on an explanation.\n",

      "Just six days out from the FNB Stadium showdown with the All Blacks, John Smit is closing in on his century of Test caps. Unlike the batsman in the nervous nineties he is sure to certain to reach three figures (unless the hamstring strain that kept him from training last week intensifies), but the match is shaping up to be as much a watershed as it is a milestone for the illustrious Springbok captain. Smit will not have been impervious to the growing clamour from disappointed fans that he is too old, too unfit and not suited to the direction in which the game is headed. He might even give it all a wry smile, shrug his shoulders and wistfully say to himself: \"Here we go again.\" Smit has been proving himself to the Springbok public for years now - he has variously been criticised as being inferior to Lukas van Biljon, Gary Botha, Schalk Brits and Bismarck du Plessis, but has always rolled up his sleeves at the coal face, seen off his competitors and then taken his game and the team to new heights. How will he respond in 2010? Smit is a champion and champions don\\'t like the feel of the canvas on their cheek. For Smit and the Springboks, this week\\'s match has so many similarities to the Battle of Bafokeng in 2006. Going into that savage showdown in Rustenburg, the Boks had lost five in a row - at home to France, three matches overseas in the Tri-Nations (including 49-0 n Brisbane) and then their first home match (45-26 in Pretoria). This year it is just the three defeats overseas, but another poor performance in losing to the New Zealanders will render life unbearable for the coaching staff and captain. Peter de Villiers probably does not understand that but Smit certainly does. He has journeyed into the Heart of Darkness and like Captain Kurtz of the Joseph Conrad classic, has seen \"the horror\". In 2006 it was common knowledge that Jake White would have been sacked had the Boks lost that day in Rustenburg, and the understanding was that the new broom would have swept out White\\'s captain. That Test was Smit\\'s 59th and the euphoria of the last minute win took the spotlight off what an incredibly confrontational match it was. As Smit later recalled: \"We had had enough (of losing). We were in the mood for a fight. We did not give a damn any more.\" And the Kiwis gave them a fight all alright, so much so that the discontent between the teams simmered away into the Sun City night when the teams met later. A year later Smit was a Rugby World Cup winning captain. A year after that the Lions had been defeated and a second Tri-Nations won. But a third year on Smit and the Boks are back to square one. Again, how will they respond? Is this the beginning of the end or will Smit\\'s 100th Test signal the start after another road to glory, ending in triumph at Eden Park in Auckland this time next year? If there is to be a signal of new intent, there is no better opposition for Smit\\'s Springboks to make it against than their famous rivals. A look back over Smit\\'s journey in the green and gold since his debut in 2000 shows some of his brightest episodes have featured the men in black. In the first year of his captaincy (2004) there was that incredible 40-26 defeat of the All Blacks at Ellis Park, with Marius Joubert scoring a hat-trick. A year later, the Boks defeated the New Zealanders 20-16 at Newlands in a match Smit describes as one of his all-time favourites. And in 2006, the 21-20 win at the Royal Bafokeng Palace gave Smit that aforementioned reprieve that led to such glory. Smit did not play against the Kiwis in the World Cup year of 2007 and was injured for the matches against them in 2008, but last year there were three fine wins in a row over the All Blacks - in Bloemfontein, Durban and Hamilton. Is another famous victory over Richie McCaw\\'s men imminent? The resilient Smit\\'s history with the Springboks would suggest so. Test 1, June 10, 2000: South Africa |51-18 Canada Nick Mallett gives Smit his debut. Test 7, November 12, 2000: Argentina 33 - 37 South Africa Smit starts his first Test.

      "AS the ANC was commissioning election posters depicting PresidentJacob Zumaalongside coloured voters, it appears this week\\'s choices by the leadership have already cooked the party\\'s goose. Not only can it kiss the Western Cape goodbye, say analysts, but municipalities everywhere may now be in reach of opposition control. The most fiercely contested could be Nelson Mandela Bay, where the ANC lost major support in 2009. The ANC has announced it is going all-out for that most elusive group - \"the coloured vote\". This group has been staying away from the polls in larger numbers than any other ethnic group. It also represents the most volatile swing vote, with few historical party loyalties. There is a pervasive sentiment among coloured voters that they are only recognised at election time and that they are also losing out along the way, particularly in the job market, having not been white enough during apartheid and now not being black enough. These views were intensified by new government spin doctor Jimmy Manyi\\'s comments that they were over-represented in the Western Cape and should spread out if they wanted jobs; and more specifically by the ANC\\'s national working committee statement this week that effectively punished National Planning Minister Trevor Manuel for his attack on Manyi, for his \"racism of the worst kind\". This \"silencing\" of Manuel has underscored coloured voters\\' worst fears about the affirmative action phrase \"blacks in general, and Africans in particular\", but it also appeared to divert from the ANC\\'s core values of non-racialism, as a number of top leaders in its ranks have remarked in the past fortnight. Keith Gottschalk, UWC political scientist, insists that Manyi\\'s comments and their defence by the ANC, and in particular by Paul Ngobeni, lawyer and special adviser to Defence Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, \"amounts to an ANC gift to the DA\\'s election campaign\". \"If the ANC is serious about winning a majority in the Western Cape, it needs to persuade its members to treat African and coloured workers the same,\" Gottschalk said. \"Of course, it is true that coloured workers did not have the dompas, but they did have one-and-a-half centuries of slavery.\" In local elections much depended on mobilising voters to make their crosses. But the portion of coloured voters who had abstained from voting had been consistently higher than for other groups, said political analyst Professor Susan Booysen. It was quite possible that the Manyi debacle could result in more stayaways, but the interesting question was whether people were sufficiently angry to \"punish\" the ANC with opposition votes. In 2009 much of the Cope vote was seen as \"punishment\" by former ANC voters. A key test for Cope, the DA and the ANC would be Port Elizabeth, where the ANC\\'s traditional 80 percent majority declined dramatically to less than 50 percent in 2009. Booysen questioned whether the Cope voters would remain loyal, but if they did, there was an opportunity for DA-ID-Cope coalitions taking over an ANC stronghold, particularly if coloured anger galvanised them to make their mark. ANC insiders campaigning in coloured areas in the Eastern Cape were at their wits\\' end this week, saying it was almost a lost cause after the government\\'s defence of Manyi. \"People are up in arms. They want to know why nobody says there are too many Xhosas in the Eastern Cape,\" one said. In the Karoo and Namaqualand, Manyi\\'s comments took on a literal meaning, with people asking whether they would be any better off if they \"spread out\" across the country in search of jobs. \"Our people are applying for jobs in the defence force, the police and correctional services, but are not being considered,\" said an ANC activist. Another, Louise Boezak of Carnarvon, who has joined Cope after decades in the ANC, said: \"People are very angry with the arroganceâ€¦ I think they have now hurt our feelings and the poor are misusedâ€¦ so is unemployment.\" Though intended as being lighthearted, Manyi\\'s comments about Indians having bargained their way into management positions have also stirred anger among Durban\\'s Indian community. Rishi Singh, chairman of the Clairwood Ratepayers\\' Association, one of the oldest Indian communities in Durban, said the community was bitter. \"It\\'s apartheid in reverse,\" Singh said. Desmond D\\'Sa, a South Durban Basin community activist and chairman of the Wentworth Development Forum, said the coloured community felt betrayed by the ANC, which they overwhelmingly supported during apartheid. \"These very communities in the south basin such as Wentworth and Merebank were at the coal face of the struggle against apartheid, having produced people like Robert McBride and (Surgeon General) Veejay Ramlakan.\" HSRC senior research specialist Dr Mcebisi Ndletyana said the fallout from the Manyi saga would affect each province and region differently. He said while Manyi had been speaking in defence of government policy, the issue might have gone unnoticed had it not been for the elections coming up. \"But (it is) useful election material for the opposition,\" he said. \"It will have the biggest effect on the Western Cape, and for the ANC much will depend on Marius Fransman\\'s ability to speak out against it.\" He also believed Cosatu\\'s proposal that provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich become the ANC\\'s mayoral candidate might help mend some of the bridges burnt in the last fortnight, \"because he is a credible and visible leader among poor coloured communities\".\n",

      "DURING the State |of the Nation debate in Parliament last month, PresidentJacob Zumawas |taken to task by opposition parties over the overarching theme of his address; radical socio-economic transformation. While the president claimed this would be the ANC and the government\\'s motivation is its programme of action for his second term, both the DA and the Economic Freedom Fighters, the two main opposition parties in Parliament, challenged this notion. They both contended that there was nothing radical about the president\\'s plans to transform the economy, land ownership patterns or job creation. To the EFF, radical means the expropriation of land without compensation and the nationalisation of key economic assets like banks and mines. This is unlikely to happen while Zuma is in office. However, as the furore over Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti\\'s policy proposals on land redistribution gained momentum in the last few weeks, one could be forgiven for thinking the minister has been |having too much coffee with |Julius Malema in the corridors on Parliament. Nkwinti has proposed a policy according to which white farmers would be forced to give up 50 percent of their land for redistribution to farmworkers. The money paid by government for the land would not go to the farmers, but would be allocated in a |fund to support the emerging black farmers with skills, training and farming equipment. Nkwinti was quick to point out this week that this was in fact |contained in the ANC\\'s own policy documents from the 2012 policy |conference. The proposal has been slammed by the Freedom Front Plus as |equal to expropriation without compensation, but it remains a policy proposal. However, government this week moved on the land issue when Zuma signed into law the land restitution and property valuation bill, which effectively reopens the process for people dispossessed of land to |submit claims. This is an ANC policy adopted at the Mangaung conference in 2012, where the phrase \"radical socio-economic transformation\" dominated ANC discussions. The phrase has been sustained and it shaped the tone of the party\\'s manifesto and Zuma\\'s State of the Nation Address. It appears that the party is succumbing to the realisation that |business can no longer continue as usual, but many would be disheartened by the previous promises of radical shifts from macro-economic policies that have failed to transform the lives of millions of the poor. The announcement by the president that government would investigate the issue of a national minimum wage should be understood in the context of growing discontent over income inequalities. It is a contentious issue between the ANC and its alliance partners on the Left, and even the president\\'s promise to \"investigate\" it was met with suspicion, especially over the lack of time frames being announced for the process The recent five-month Amcu strike in the mining sector, which had a negative effect on the economy and might still result in the loss of jobs in the sector, has shown how urgent the equal distribution of the country\\'s resources is. The realignment of power among the labour unions - Cosatu-affiliated National Union of Mineworkers is being ravaged by the growth of Amcu and Numsa planning a break-away from Cosatu - are indications that labour might become the new frontier over which the battle for socio-economic transformation is fought during this term. But if there is one thing that unions agree on, it is the introduction of the national minimum wage. Introducing it would go a long way in addressing the income inequalities in the labour market, but its most vocal critics believe it will be detrimental to job creation. Government\\'s target of 5 percent growth by 2019 is an ambitious |target that, if realised, would in all likelihood see the creation of more jobs, but this will not be easy. Figures released by Statistics SA last month showed the country\\'s gross domestic product (GDP) |had contracted 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year. This was its first contraction since the second quarter of 2009, when the global economy was sliding into a recession. Zuma was to start his first term in the same year, and he has now started his second time when unemployment remains incredibly high, especially among the youth. Government appears to be relying on massive infrastructure development project for the creation |of more than 6 million jobs by 2019, but unions are convinced that these are not \"real jobs\". The main election issue in the run-up to the recently held elections was the economy, and the ANC appears to realise that massive job creation is not possible in an economy that is not growing, or that growing too little too slowly. The establishment of the Small Business Development ministry, |and the appointment of Lindiwe Zulu as the minister for this portfolio, has signalled the need for an emphasis on the development of small businesses as a means to |create jobs. It shows government can no longer rely on big business to create jobs, and that the informal sector has never been this important to the growth of the overall economy. The deployment of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan to the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs was a big appointment that probably signals emphasis on service delivery. Gordhan is heading a department which is at the coalface of service delivery, and the number of service delivery protests that have taken place this year alone indicates how fed up people are with the lack of delivery by most municipalities. This week, the president announced the appointment of various inter-ministerial committees, including that of service delivery which Gordhan will chair. According to the presidency, |its purpose is to fast-track service delivery in areas where there are bottlenecks, quickly respond to areas where there are service delivery problems and ensure that general service delivery is improved. This will be particularly important for the government and the ruling party as the local government elections are set to take place in 2016. The forced removals of residents in Lwandle saw government responding with speed, with |ministers dispatched to the area as soon as news of the evictions made the headlines. While ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe maintains this will be a standard response to such issue by the executive, it remains to be seen whether it will be maintained throughout the term. But more importantly, the response that communities are crying out for is the actual delivery of the services they are protesting over. This week the country was faced with rolling power outages in |various regions, highlighting the massive power constraints the country still has to deal with. The National Planning Commission and the Department of Energy are known to have argued for the delay in the procurement of nuclear energy, but government is intent on forging ahead in the face of massive energy constraints to the economy. This perhaps signals a radical shift from an administration that has previously appeared content with leaving Eskom and the SA Nuclear Energy Corporation to come up with ways of increasing the country\\'s energy security. It is perhaps against this background that there seems to be more focus on a \"sustainable energy mix\" that includes coal, solar, wind, hydro, gas and nuclear energy. Some of the measures that government is introducing are described by critics as long over due, and far from being radical. However, it can be argued that the sounds coming from government indicate a somewhat belated realisation that business can no longer be done as usual. mogomotsi.magome@inl.co.za\n",

      "One could write an entire thesis on the ANC government\\'s faults regarding revenue expenditure - whether it be tender corruption, government\\'s wasteful spending, the bloated cabinet, the public sector wage bill, the nuclear deal with Russia or Nkandla - the ANC\\'s track record does not inspire confidence. However, I would like to focus on the former concern - that is - how revenue is divided. After making provision for debt-service costs, the total revenue available for the 2015 national Budget amounts to approximately R1.1 trillion. Of this, the national share of non-interest expenditure is about 48 percent, provinces receive 43 percent and 9 percent goes to municipalities. Persistent slow economic growth has resulted in the economy failing to raise the revenue needed to balance the Budget. Therefore, in order to balance the Budget, the deficit has to be funded by increasing debt which is currently R1.584 billion. The net debt has grown from 21.8 percent in 2009, when Jacob Zuma became president, to 40.8 percent in 2014/15. Debt-servicing costs for the 2014/15 financial year are estimated to be R115bn. This is more than a worrying trend, and the result is there is less money for government to spend effectively. What follows is that revenue allocations to the three spheres of government, particularly for provinces and local government, will grow at a slower rate than previous years. Moreover, there will be reductions of R11bn in the allocations for provinces and an almost R2bn reduction in allocations to local government over the next two fiscal years. The impact this will have on service delivery cannot be overstated. Municipalities and local government are at the coal face of service delivery and economic growth, as city-led infrastructure growth paves the way for job creation, yet only 9 percent of the national revenue is allocated to local government. Zuma proudly boasts about government\\'s \"back to basics\" local government revitalisation programme. However, with insufficient funds and maladministration at local government level, it seems the government is turning its back on basics - basic service delivery and basic infrastructure growth. Without sufficient funds, local government cannot function optimally, which has far-reaching negative effects on service delivery and infrastructure growth. Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene stated that local government received a smaller share of the division of revenue because municipalities had significant revenue raising powers, which include property rates and service charges. Thus, according to Nene, for local government to function effectively, the bulk of its revenue will not come from national government, but from the pockets of the people. While there are substantive objections to this approach that are beyond the scope of this discussion, it is the procedural hurdles that are relevant here. According to the Treasury, aggregate consumer debt that is owed to municipalities amounted to a massive R96.6bn as of December 31, most of which is realistically not collectable. This amount has more than doubled since 2010, when the figure was R43bn. In other words, even if this was substantively fair and agreed to, in practice it simply isn\\'t working. Municipalities are failing to collect this revenue, meaning Nene\\'s reasoning does not hold. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Pravin Gordhan made a commitment to cut this debt owed to municipalities, yet we see no progress on this matter. This is yet another example of an ANC cabinet that is at odds with itself. We see one minister pointing to local governments own seemingly functional revenue raising ability, yet another minister pointing out the glaring failures in that revenue- raising ability, suggesting changes to the way municipalities collect money.

      "At the the beginning of every South African academic year the same concerns are raised by teachers and parents; too many learners, too few teachers, overcrowded classrooms, too few resources and lack of infrastructure. The situation, according to most educators, is getting worse. What has to change? Basically everything, believe those who are trying to revolutionise the way that learners and those entering the tertiary sector are taught. In short, say this new breed of learning innovators, you not only have to think out of the box, you have to invent a new box - a digital one that may incorporate artificial intelligence or one that finds a way to dramatically improve the quality of teaching. When you have a class of only 10 matrics and they all fail, you know something has gone wrong. When you have substantially more boys than girls sitting for their final exams, you know the system is not working. Many of those advocating radical changes are teachers already at the coal face dealing with what they say are \"insurmountable\" odds. Among them is long-serving Western Cape teacher and advocate of change, Maryke Bailey who in a recent interview said that overcrowding in the classrooms remains a number one issue with teachers struggling to deliver effective lessons to over 50-60 children. \"We are failing our children in terms of resources and class sizes, but the problem is bigger than that. There is a teaching crisis in South Africa. We are not producing teacher excellence across the board, and lack of resources and the overcrowding just add to the problem. \"We have to come up with creative ways in which teachers can teach effectively even in adverse conditions.\" Stellenbosch-based professor Patrick Bean, executive dean of STADIO Faculty of Education and Humanities\\' School of Education (formerly Embury) believes that one way to improve the quality of education is to embrace the rapid development of technology and connectivity around the world and use distance learning as an educational tool. \"The main goal of introducing technology into education must be to level the playing fields - making education accessible to everybody, beyond the geographical and/or wealth barriers.\" The idea is not falling on deaf ears. President Cyril Ramaphosa\\'s ambitious target to ensure that every school child in the country has access to a tablet with digital workbooks and textbooks within the next six years could be the starting point together with his introduction of compulsory early childhood education. \"We will start with those schools that have been historically most disadvantaged and are located in the poorest communities,\" he said. Some may see the tablet idea as putting the cart before the horse. Others, like Bean, see it as the beginning of a home-grown digital learning revolution. Let\\'s look at who\\'s doing what in this brave new world of learning. On a global scale, one of those leading the way to a digital transition in schools and tertiary institutions is the Learning Counsel, a mission-based online organisation that recently developed one of the first thesis of education\\'s future, based on technology\\'s evolution. \"Our aim,\" said one of thecounsel\\'s new-age educators \"is to help schools advance systematically with the digital transition, which in our view is no longer an option, but a fast-accelerating reality.\" Educational gaming might sound like an oxymoron, but it\\'s a button that is being pushed more and more by those seeking solutions to overcrowding and lack of resources like we have in South Africa. Said Suzi Wilczynski, an independent developer of interactive educational games for kids, \"Learning games are built the same way a teacher builds a lesson. \"I believe that games can change the way kids learn.\" She admits it\\'s no small venture. \"A single game requires the work of skilled writers, game designers, educators, artists, game architects, and database developers. It may sound daunting, but whether we like it or not, it is the way that future learning is going.\" In one of her latest interactive \"edu\" games, Grade 8 pupils are invited to travel through space to distant planets with a make-believe scientist who explains the chemical components of each planet and whether life would be possible. A former archaeologist and middle school teacher, she said she founded her Dig-It! Games learning platform, because there was, in her view, a \"crying need\" for a seamless blend of fun and learning for children. \"We start with a learning goal and then we work backwards.\" One of the key issues, she said, was that textbooks, especially in poorer communities, were not affordable and often not available. An added problem was that in a rapidly changing world textbooks that took a year or so to publish, could be out of date by the time they reached the classroom. \"Today children are themselves activists for change,\" said Jamie Beaton chief executive of Crimson Education, a start up dedicated to connecting learners from over the world to resources, mentors and career pathways that are right for them. Currently, the company has a network of more than 2000 expert tutors, consultants and mentors across the globe. \"Education must be restructured to ensure it prepares pupils for the digital world they will be working in. This means combining elements of traditional teaching with new digital frameworks for learning skills. \"The idea of \\'gamifying\\' the learning environment is crucial in tapping into the young Gen Z brains.\" The idea behind Game-based learning, said Beaton, was that it enabled students to actively engage with the material they were studying and the brain processes challenges and mistakes that transpired. \"We don\\'t need more time in the classroom to learn how to think and perform in the face of real-world challenges. We need effective, interactive experiences that motivate and actively engage us in the learning process.\" At this point you might ask: what\\'s the point of teachers? The answer to that, said educators like Bean, was to look at blended learning models that included personal interaction with teachers and lecturers, as well as a strong distance education component. \"Today E-learning forms part of most distance learning (and contact learning) options and offers a richer experience encompassing every imaginable format of web-based learning, from digital textbooks to video lectures and virtual reality experiences.\" There are, however, challenges to the uptake of e-learning in South Africa. One is connectivity and high costs of data. The king of innovators, Elon Musk said connectivity for the masses was in his sights, sooner than later. Could this mean that AI \"coaches\" or \"teachers\" would soon be able to prompt pupils to finish coursework, suggest new content and answerquestions? It\\'s a brave new world. The question is: will South Africa be ready for it. Should we ask Siri, or wait forthe next click and drag in the Echapter?\n",

      "With pic A tribute to the late Monde Tabata By David Moshapalo In 1995, the minister of Trade and Industry (DTI), Alec Erwin invited the two major black business formations - Fabcos, representing mainly informal businesses, and Nafcoc, a black chamber of commerce, to facilitate and drive the establishment of an umbrella body to act as his sounding board. This body had to have representation in all the nine new provinces of SA. The instruction was also to include other businesses outside the two established black business membership bases. Its very representative board, supported by a small secretariat, had to reflect the demographics of ABC (Africans, Coloureds and Indians) in line with the new SA Constitution. With a small head office Secretariat and a National footprint. This national body was called the National Small Business Council (NSBC) and I was elected its first president. At the time I was the Secretary-General of Fabcos, and I proposed to the NSBC that we invite Monde Tabata to head our secretariat on a volunteer basis until the funding and contractual agreement for the NSBC had been finalized with DTI. He was a member of the National Black Business Caucus (NBBC) which had participated in an interaction with the ANC at Phinda Game Reserve in Natal and Mopani in the Kruger National Park in anticipation of the new ANC-led government and a bright future for the black South Africans post the demise of apartheid. Tabata attended with yours truly the Mopani deliberations - a brainchild of Willie Ramoshaba, a black business activist and a distinguished publisher of Enterprise Magazine. Tabata was always in the forefront of what was happening at that historic event. He and an equally energetic Xolani Qubeka were elected scribes of various discussion breakaway groups. We later went on a number of study tours overseas to find a model that we could localize and settled on America\\'s Small Business Administration (SBA). This formation had a lobby element and other services it offered to its broad membership. It was respected for its successful support programmes that assisted the minorities especially women-owned firms and those owned by African Americans and Latinos. Our objective was to empower the majority of black South Africans who were excluded from the main stream economy. When funding for the NSBC was concluded with the DTI months later, the selection of Tabata as CEO was made permanent. This was a unanimous decision. Our NSBC executive members were drafted into the various DTI task teams. Our delegation was ably led by the charismatic and energetic Tabata. The outcome of this extensive work was a proposal to establish two government agencies: namely, Ntsika to offer small businesses non-financial support, and Khula to offer them financial support. In 1995, a huge historical SMME conference was held in Durban, and Tabata pulled it off with a small NSBC team. After vigorous debates and inputs by the delegates it was agreed that the two agencies would complement the services that were provided and sold by the black business federations and chambers to their members. Historically, the black business bodies were struggling financially because they were providing services to many struggling black small and micro enterprises. Some could not pay their stipulated membership dues. Being at the coal face, Tabata was frustrated by how things turned out later after the SMMEs Conference. Ntsika was perceived by the black organizations to be unfair competition to them by offering free training and other services to their existing members and potential members. These issues were raised sharply with Tabata and this was always an agenda item on our work programme. Khula\\'s credit guarantee scheme for SMMEs was largely ignored or poorly supported by the established four big banks. Tabata championed a shared services model for the agencies and the black businesses movements as proposed by the NSBC board. Unfortunately his proposals were not accepted by DTI. The agencies have since been rebranded and their activities and offerings have been refocused. Sadly, the NSBC is no more. Today 25 years later it is sad to see that the black businesses in the \"klein dorpies\" are still struggling financially though some are represented on the boards of these DTI agencies. Regrettably, our vision for a stronger and vibrant SMME Government support has not been realized. We are hopeful that in his memory and others who have passed on the Black Economic Struggle Stage the ministry of small business will scale up support for this key part of the South African economy. I salute Tabata, and take comfort in his numerous achievements before and after the fanfare of the short-lived era of the NSBC. His successful career in the corporate world, charity and his passion in the promotion of rugby in the Eastern Cape defined his stature as a giant. Lala ngoxolo Mawawa, Mpinga!

At the time Knight, now 34, was trying to find a way to stay at the e-commerce coal face in London but use the expertise of programmers in SA. As part of this Knight started his own conference, called Tech4Africa, the second instalment of which finished last week. Last year the keynotes were delivered by Clay Shirky, the pre-eminent thinker on new media, and Leila Janah, who founded Samasource, a revolutionary way of finding \"microwork\" for people in the world\\'s poorest places. This year Ghanaian entrepreneur Herman Chinery-Hesse, often described as the Bill Gates of Africa, and digital strategist Josh Spear spoke at Tech4Africa. Other speakers included tech luminaries from Twitter, Yahoo!, Digg, Google, Apple, Virgin, Mozilla and Amazon. Said Knight: \"I originally wanted to create an environment where I can hire good people. The only way I can do that is expose them to global experts. There aren\\'t any in South Africa. \"And there\\'s nothing like standing in front of global thought leaders and getting inspired and going out and building things. It\\'s happened to me a few times and I hope it can happen to other people.\" Knight has dug into his own pocket to bring in the tech luminaries to South Africa. \"It has all been bootstrapped in the true sense of the word,\" he said. Bootstrapping is an unknown concept to most people outside of the tech world. It is effectively launching a new business using scarce resources and with no external funding. Knight is a master of this form of entrepreneurship. His seventh start-up (T4A would be his eighth) was Kindo. It was the world\\'s fastest- growing family-tree social website before he sold it to MyHeritage, the largest such site. As part of this year\\'s event, Knight and fellow South African entrepreneur, Vinny Lingham, gave a no-holds-barred account of their early days starting up businesses. San Francisco-based Lingham\\'s Yola.com lets its users build their own websites and it now has 6-million users as well as deals with HP and Google. In 2009 Business Week named it 19th among the top 50 global start-ups. Knight\\'s latest venture - through his company, Technovated - is a clever use of current web technologies that enables him to provide what\\'s called multi-niche e-commerce sites. As part of this he is now selling everything from mattresses to coffee tables, furniture to beds, using an e-commerce platform he built. \"Whatever we build in one store we roll out in other stores,\" Knight said. He runs it from London but employs South African programmers back at home too. But it\\'s not been easy. \"I\\'ve spoken to a lot of people who have raised money. We raised a fifth of what we should have. \"We\\'ve been pushed hard by the investors to prove it and it\\'s working. We\\'ve proven we can do it. With e-commerce you\\'ve got to have cash to bridge you over the start-up phase.\" He said he\\'s learnt invaluable lessons from his various businesses. \"The one thing I have learnt over the last year and half is perspective. I\\'ve had so many ups and downs. You can\\'t get upset at the first sign of trouble and can\\'t get excited at the first sign of success. You have to have a sense of perspective.\" Knight certainly proves that South Africa\\'s best export are South Africans themselves. TRUE MAN OF ACTION: Gareth Knight Picture: TOBY SHAPSHAK\n",

      "M& R \\'fobbed off\\' whistle-blower Paper trail points to series of dire warnings on collusion and corruption SENSATIONAL new documents show that despite its heated denials Murray & Roberts\\' top brass were well-aware of corruption in the construction industry for many years. The documents, obtained by Business Times reporters, call into question the \"public apology\" from CEO Henry Laas, reported in this newspaper last year, and the view of his predecessor, Brian Bruce, who called the collusion the actions of \"rogue hoods\". Laas and Bruce, who led Murray & Roberts for more than a decade, claim they were not aware of any collusion, implying that only junior officials were involved. Murray & Roberts was fined R309-million for its role in 17 acts of collusion, including working on the R4.5-billion Green Point Stadium for the 2010 World Cup. It was one of the largest offenders, as 18 major construction firms were fined R1.46-billion. Murray & Roberts colluded with other firms, including Stefanutti Stocks, Aveng and WBHO, to rip off the public on a large number of projects, including construction of the Green Point Stadium and the Gautrain and the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project, for which e-tolls are now being levied on consumers. Yet none of the executives has yet been charged or fired. Junior employees are carrying the can. Today\\'s revelations raise sharp questions about how seriously large JSE-listed corporations treat whistle-blowers with evidence of corruption. One Murray & Roberts insider, who worked as a senior manager at the coal face where the collusion took place, wrote a letter to Bruce on January 31 2007, detailing incidents in which collusion and corruption had taken place. This letter to Bruce was sent at the time when construction firms were bidding for World Cup stadium projects. The first time he blew the whistle on shady activities at the company was two years before. Yet Murray & Roberts did not admit publicly to any collusion for many years. In its 2013 annual report, Laas said that \"since the first of these matters came to light in 2008, the board and executive has left no stone unturned in our efforts to rid the group of any such practices\". In response to questions this week, Murray & Roberts spokesman Ed Jardim rejected the suggestion it had ignored the tip-off. He said the group had been \"proactive in investigating and rooting out any alleged wrongful conduct. The collusive conduct came about as a result of the unauthorised actions of certain subsidiary managers ... no longer with the group.\" But the insider, who did not want to be named as he still works in the industry and feared being persecuted, said that Murray & Roberts failed to root out the shady practices when first alerted. \"Nothing ever came from my efforts or letters to try and alert the necessary people to the corruption that was ongoing,\" he said. His letters detail 15 incidents in which he could show collusion had taken place, dating back to 2001. In an affidavit he subsequently gave to the police, he detailed kick-backs to sub-contractors, the existence of a \"slush fund\", extortion and unjustified payments to consultants. In one such letter to Murray & Roberts in February 2006, he detailed how the top five construction firms held \"regular strategy meetings\", attended by the managing directors, to \"allocate the various mega projects on offer amongst the various members of the club\" - including the contract to build the Cape Town Convention Centre. At its AGM last year, Murray & Roberts finally admitted to collusion in the tender for that convention centre. In another project, he described how \"a few days before [the] submission of the tender, we would telephonically inform the other members what their submitted price had to be, which had been predetermined by us\". Yet this method of \"cover pricing\" was publicly revealed only last year, as part of the Competition Commission probe, years after he had first informed Murray & Roberts. The criminal case collapsed mainly, the insider said, because the police did not receive proper assistance from Murray & Roberts. Yet the corruption continued, and reached a peak a few months later, when the World Cup tenders were being rolled out. In one letter to Murray & Roberts in 2007, the whistle-blower said he \"had to endure open and subtle threats\" by other staff, before he eventually quit. When he asked why nothing was happening to eradicate this behaviour, Murray & Roberts\\' lawyer, Millard Arnold, sent him a letter in February 2007, saying \"the delays, if any, in pursuing your complaint rests entirely in the hands of the SAPS and National Prosecuting Authority\". In recent months, Millard has publicly stated he was unaware of corrupt practices at the company. Yet this letter raises questions over whether Murray & Roberts was as thorough in seeking to root out corruption. Jardim said it did everything it could, even hiring lawyers and forensic experts to probe the claims relating to the Cape building business between 2001 and 2004. \"We have a long and proven history of cooperation with the authorities,\" he said. He said it was one of the first construction firms to \"proactively commence a comprehensive internal review of its operations\". But the source is not the sole whistle-blower with evidence of poor ethical conduct at Murray & Roberts. New evidence has emerged from a former Murray & Roberts employee named Corrie Gordon in which he alerted the company to the shady activities. In a letter and e-mail, dated August 30 2010, Gordon wrote to Laas alerting him to the possibility of corrupt and unethical practices. At the time, Laas was MD of Murray & Roberts\\' cementation division before replacing Bruce in the top job in 2011. \"All they did was sent me from pillar-to-post, organising meetings and then cancelling again ... I never actually had a meeting with Laas or the HR manager, Theunis Mienie, who I was pawned off on, because they decided I was a disgruntled employee,\" he told Business Times this week. Gordon highlighted suspicious activities during Murray & Roberts\\' building of a massive mining shaft for Impala Platinum in 2004 - in that case shaft number 20. He worked as a planner on the project and, after it became clear that the construction was falling behind, he produced a plan to limit the delays on the delivery of the shaft. The main shaft and the ventilation shaft were supposed to be delivered at the same time. But, according to Gordon, Murray & Roberts stopped working on the ventilation shaft to ensure the main shaft was delivered on time - only because there was a bonus for doing so on this part of the project. But after this bonus was collected, said Gordon, the rest of project was deliberately \"stretched\" out, and ended up being 400 days late. \"When I started to ask questions about why my plan was not being used, I was simply demoted and then retrenched. When I asked for meetings to discuss the issues I was ignored,\" said a sombre-looking Gordon. Murray & Roberts rejects Gordon\\'s claims, saying it did try and meet him. It claimed Gordon was demoted because he didn\\'t have the skills to fulfil his job as a site planner, and was retrenched as part of a wider redundancy process.

      "The Last Word. . Avoid Lonmin like the Bermuda Triangle THERE\\'s more than one reason why investors would do well to steer clear of Lonmin, the world\\'s third-largest platinum company. Lonmin, headquartered in London but mining solely in the Bushveld complex, is the fine institution that brought you the era-defining slaughter at its Marikana mine in 2012. Fast-forward two years, and what is Lonmin doing now? Well, it turns out it is trying to gag critics with \"interdicts\", ignoring shareholders and claiming that its evidence to the Farlam commission on Marikana is secret. It wasn\\'t meant to be like that. When 46-year-old Ben Magara, Anglo Coal\\'s highly rated boss, took over from Ian Farmer as CEO in July last year, people crossed their fingers, hoping that he would dial back years of shoddy leadership. Magara told journalists his management style was to \"get to the coalface\". \"My approach is to get to know the people and they will tell me what needs to be done,\" he told one. And yet, Magara\\'s \"new Lonmin\" is anything but keen to engage. Two weeks ago, a nongovernmental group, the Alternative Information and Development Centre (AIDC), said it would release a report, drawn from evidence at the Farlam commission, on how Lonmin ships profits through Bermuda, a tax haven. So what did Magara\\'s company do? It dashed to court for an interdict to stop the AIDC and its Swedish economist, Dick Forslund, from \"presenting or publishing in any form whatsoever, any report based on information disclosed in the course of the [Marikana] hearings\". In its application, Lonmin argued that the evidence given to Farlam was \"confidential\". And the AIDC, it said, was \"clearly aiming to disseminate information that could only have been derived from the commission\". Imagine the chutzpah. How dare the AIDC try to place the results of a public commission, set up so the public would know why Marikana happened, in the public domain? You can see why Lonmin is aghast. In the end, the interdict case did not happen. Lonmin reached an out-of-court deal with Forslund to delay the report - which was eventually released this week anyway. Forslund\\'s report makes for interesting reading - but that isn\\'t the issue. Rather, it is the bullyboy tactics of a company using its financial muscle to pull the shutters closed. Lonmin spokeswoman Sue Vey defended this position by saying the AIDC report contained \"conclusions drawn on the evidence, and that\\'s Farlam\\'s responsibility\". Forslund, for one, doesn\\'t buy it. He said: \"Surely this is part of the national healing process that people discuss this? These documents were tabled as public information at the Farlam commission, so how can Lonmin claim it is \\'confidential\\'?\" But it is not just tree-hugging hipsters who Lonmin has a problem with. It turns out it doesn\\'t have much time for its own shareholders either. One shareholder, the Cape Town-based asset manager Northstar, got so frustrated at the perpetual brushoffs that it took the unusual step of writing an open letter to Lonmin, imploring it to please answer the phone, return an e-mail, anything. The letter, dated October 6 and sent to Magara, said that, since February, its analysts had been asking for pretty important information. \"No response was forthcoming,\" it said. So Northstar changed tack, arranging a meeting for September 4 with Magara and executive Simon Scott through one of Lonmin\\'s banks. Two analysts flew to Lonmin\\'s fancy HQ in Johannesburg\\'s Melrose Arch to meet them, but \"the meeting was cancelled at the last moment\". Perhaps we can understand why. After all, there were some pretty important issues to discuss - such as how has Lonmin\\'s cash flow recovered from the five-month strike, its sizable debt and the board\\'s competence. Speaking this week, Northstar MD Adrian Clayton said Lonmin had since \"apologised, engaged us and answered our questions\". The thing is, Northstar has not had this experience with any other JSE-listed company. \"It\\'s not something we\\'re used to,\" Clayton said. \"Our concern was that it was quite opaque and we needed to understand what is going on.\" You would imagine that the least you could do if you were Magara - who took home R12.5-million for three months\\' work last year - is try to placate shareholders. Especially given that since July 2007 Lonmin\\'s share price has plunged 90% from R332.87 to R32.77 - not exactly a rousing sign of investor confidence. So much for Magara\\'s pledge of open arms, and how he loves \"getting to know the people\".\n",

      "Fire. Impetuous president fails to put SA first THE sun is about to set on what has been a very turbulent year. Our business-as-usual atmosphere has been shaken up by the mayhem caused by PresidentJacob Zumawhen he changed finance ministers twice in four days. We will never forget that. It was dramatic, outrageous and an epic failure of leadership whose impact continues to be felt. Although the capricious markets have slowly settled, there is no doubt that South Africa bled. Those in denial have concocted political conspiracy theories, pitting capitalists and the West against our poor nation. Regardless of the stark evidence, they have refused to see the simple truth that we suffered because of our president\\'s ineptitude. In firing former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, Zuma indeed used his prerogative - as if that was ever the debate - but he did not use it to put South Africa first. South Africans all have their own views about the worst moments of that disorderly week. For some the worst was when Nene was fired by a dull president whose communication skills need serious intervention. At that point, Zuma did not think that he owed anyone an explanation for this extraordinary decision. Two days later, three press statements were issued in one day. The worst for some was the immediate and continued tumbling of the markets and near annihilation of our currency. For others, the appointment of little-known David van Rooyen to this crucial post and his first speech about \"demystifying the Treasury\\' were the lowest points. For me, the nadir came a few hours before Zuma announced the shifting of Pravin Gordhan back to finance from co-operative governance. It confirmed once and for all that our president simply does not understand what is going on. It would be slightly comforting if he had grasped the unfolding events, but he had chosen to ignore them in pursuit of his ambitions. But the situation is worse because it is a combination of ambition, impetuousness and lack of ability. On that Sunday, before announcing Gordhan\\'s reappointment to the Treasury, a smug president addressed a gathering in Mpumalanga where he told people to ignore those who \"talk too much on television\". This complicates the argument of Lindiwe Zulu, minister of small business development, that business does not communicate. Business, civil society and academia amplified their voice - but Zuma was not listening. Instead, he told his audience to also switch off. And there are many business leaders who have been roasted for daring to criticise the government, but that is a conversation for another day. Instead of listening to the four days of discontent, Zuma idiotically stuck to his guns and said ministers were never removed or appointed for no reason. He missed the fact that his reasons had been costly and Nene\\'s yet-to-be-defined role at a Brics bank counted for less than the market stability and economic growth for which South Africa is desperate. As the tremors were still being felt, he was the only one who still did not get it. That is depressing. A lot has happened since - the governing party intervened, denied intervening, admitted intervening, blamed business for Zuma\\'s tardy management of the country and criticised the media - but failed to put the spotlight on the main protagonist. We are entering a crucial year of local government elections. This tier of government is closest to the people and is the coal face of service delivery. And we know that service delivery is the bedrock of any nation\\'s development. It requires skills, expertise, compassion and adroitness. In South Africa, protests about delivery have been explosive and persistent. Everyone seemed to breathe a sigh of relief that Van Rooyen was removed from the Treasury, but is anyone asking what makes him suitable for the critical co-operative governance and traditional affairs portfolio? I do not know much about him, except what those who have worked with him in Merafong and parliament have had to say. At best they merely acknowledge him. Many can barely remember him. No one has said he is a trailblazer. I am deeply concerned that the ANC and the government seem to be suggesting that if Van Rooyen is not suitable for the Treasury, he will automatically be suitable for local government. Maybe, but dare we experiment at such a critical time? I think not.\n",

      "A test for democracy, and for Cyril and John It is hard to believe that there was a time in SA when local government elections were not considered as significant as they are these days. The run-up to the polls would be low key compared with what happened when national and provincial elections were held. The turnout would also be much lower, and this was often read as indication that the electorate wasn\\'t as inspired by local candidates as they were by national political figures. Yet local government was, and continues to be, at the coal face of service delivery. A municipality\\'s performance, or lack thereof, directly affects the lives of citizens living within its boundaries. Now, even though significantly fewer people still turn out for municipal elections than they do for national and provincial ones, the picture has changed. There has been more public focus on the state of our municipalities during the current campaign season than we have seen before. Anecdotal evidence suggests that voters are paying closer attention to who the candidates are in their wards than they did in the past, which partly explains the increase in the number of people running as independents. Pity, however, that in most areas, political parties did not create platforms where their candidates could present their plans for their wards and have those interrogated by the communities they seek to represent. This would have enhanced the quality of the process. But as much as these elections are primarily about bread-and-butter issues at municipality and ward levels, we cannot escape that they are also a referendum on the performances of political parties, various tiers of government and individual national leaders. In this edition of the Sunday Times, for instance, ANC national executive committee member and veteran communicator Nkenke Kekana opens his opinion piece on the elections by admitting that \"corruption is pervasive in the government\", that \"in several instances our comrades are not distinguishable from criminals\", and that a \"lack of ethics has tainted the credibility\" of the governing party. He does so out of recognition that when millions of citizens cast their votes tomorrow, on their minds will not just be whether their local authorities are able to provide basic services such as running water, electricity and tarred roads. With their Xs, voters will also be expressing their views on the government\\'s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the personal protective equipment corruption scandals, Eskom\\'s inability to guarantee power and many other issues that have exercised the minds of the public since the country last went to the polls, in 2019. Much of the attention in the days immediately after tomorrow\\'s voting will turn to the horse- trading in a number of metros that are likely to once again have hung councils. But in the not so distant future, the overall results will be revisited - and used as a performance scorecard for at least two of the country\\'s national leaders. John Steenhuisen rose to become the leader of the official opposition on the back of the DA\\'s less than impressive performance in the 2019 general elections. How the party does at the polls tomorrow will be seen as DA voters\\' comment on how he has fared in office since taking over from Mmusi Maimane. If the party fails to arrest the vote-bleeding that started in 2019, he may not be around in 2024 to lead the party\\'s campaign in the general election. Equally in the spotlight is President Cyril Ramaphosa. Let\\'s exclude, for a moment, the allegations that millions of rands pumped into his campaign essentially bought him victory at Nasrec in 2017; Ramaphosa largely owes his ascent to the ANC presidency to the party\\'s poor showing at the 2016 local government elections under then president Jacob Zuma. Those results, when the party lost a couple of metros, so spooked many of its leaders that they turned on Zuma and started looking for a leader who would help them avoid dipping below 50%. He delivered in 2019 and some pundits even credit him with the party\\'s success in winning an outright, but slim, majority in Gauteng when most expected it to fall short. But has he done enough since the 2019 elections to help his party secure outright victories in Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni - metros that slipped out of the party\\'s hands amid claims that voters were put off by Zuma? Ramaphosa and Steenhuisen were upbeat at the end of their campaigns yesterday, with the president even telling this newspaper that his party \"will surprise many people who thought the ANC was on its knees\". However, it is out of their hands now. It is time for the electorate to give its verdict. People from the settlement of Boikhutso collect water from a tanker in Lichtenburg. Poor service delivery has made local governance an ever more urgent issue in SA.Alaister Russell\n",

      "We can\\'t leave the fight against corruption to the government Civil society needs to carve out a role as an active partner, making our democracy participatory At the 54th conference of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa was elected president by the narrowest of margins - he obtained 51.9% of the vote. The Zondo commission has shown beyond doubt that South Africa was trapped in corruption so widespread that we have to ask ourselves what led to it becoming systemic. We know that a host of institutions that make up our democracy were hollowed out so that the looting and plunder of our country\\'s resources could take place with impunity. One shudders to think where our country would be if Ramaphosa had not been elected. Despite the fact that we as a country have made significant progress in changing the lives of our people, we face the danger that unless we immediately take the right actions we may wipe out that progress. In our debates and discussions about what to do we are long on diagnoses and short on immediate and practical steps. Reaching the vision set out in the Freedom Charter and marshalling the country out of its current plight demands that we focus on the immediate measures we have to implement. If we don\\'t do so, then disarray and disillusionment with democracy will grow. On the immediate agenda three issues stand out. The campaign to weed out corruption must be unrelenting and gather momentum. The steps being taken to repair the damage wrought on the entire chain of the criminal justice system are beginning to bear results. We are only beginning to stem the tide of corruption. But it is critical that this campaign must grow into a national effort. Second, we must disentangle service delivery from corruption and incompetence. Unless we do so at the local and municipal level we shall give no cause for people to have faith in the future. Third, we must take steps to ensure that this is done in ways that make citizens participants. The media and civil society played, and continue to play, a critical role in exposing corruption and enforcing accountability. Armed now with the Zondo report, we cannot leave the task in the government\\'s hands alone. Zondo recommends that \"the government give consideration to the creation of a statutory offence rendering it a criminal offence for any person vested with public power to abuse [that] power ... by using [it] otherwise than in good faith for a proper purpose\". He suggests this crime should carry a maximum penalty of a R200m fine or 20 years in prison or both. Nothing prevents a civil society organisation from drafting the necessary legislation and lobbying the leaders of political parties to table and promote it in parliament, if necessary as a private member\\'s bill. Let each party be canvassed, and let those who are unwilling stand exposed for paying lip-service to fighting corruption. Why has no-one undertaken this task already? Zondo\\'s proposal was made public 10 months ago, and there is no draft in sight. Another example: it is common practice for employees to resign before disciplinary proceedings commence. Zondo informs us that there is no legal recourse available to address this issue. Is this not a matter that could be addressed through the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac)? None of the sectors are precluded from bringing a matter of national interest to Nedlac, where the government, business, labour and civil society are represented. Surely the unions have an interest in and are best placed to play a significant role in preventing people from getting away with wrongdoing by resigning before disciplinary proceedings commence. It is common cause that local government is the coal face for the delivery of services. The auditor-general\\'s reports have long pointed to the dismal state of municipal and district councils. Communities despair of the delivery of basic services. Is this not the place where we should be initiating and implementing measures, where participatory democracy should be rooted? Our legislation provides for establishing ward committees. Despite our desire to create a people-centred and participatory democracy, little has been done to make ward councillors engage in the ward committees in ways that involve the communities. It should be a forum where communities have a say in what services should be prioritised for their area, as well as monitoring and giving feedback on whether funds allocated for their area have been properly used. This again is an area relating to the building of our democracy that cannot be left solely to the elected councillors. Civil society needs to carve out a role as an active partner, making our democracy participatory. While I raise these issues as challenges to civil society, I am mindful of the centrality of the ANC putting its house in order. We need to remind ourselves that we learn more from our mistakes than from our achievements. The obstacle to learning from our mistakes arises because attempts to interrogate the experience of 28 years of building our democracy become enmeshed in playing the blame game. We cannot resist using mistakes - be they acts of omission or commission - to score points in inter-party rivalry and intraparty jostling for access to opportunity and power. Our constitution is founded on the understanding that the tension between the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and the chapter 9 institutions is what makes our democracy dynamic. Included in this dynamism is the tension between these state organs and the media and civil society. This tension provides the guardrails against power and patronage trampling on the fundamental rights of citizens. The ANC engages in propaganda because its purpose is to justify, explain and enlist the support of the public. Walter Sisulu, under whose tenure as secretary-general the ANC became mass-based, always found it necessary to explain that in carrying out our work we must never mislead the people, never tell them lies, and never cause division. Regrettably these precepts seem to be forgotten by so many involved in the factionalism and jostling for access to opportunity, patronage and power. For such people, self-interest trumps national interest. Lessons learnt in the process of becoming a mass party have helped us to steer a path during many crises we faced. We succeeded because we stayed true to Sisulu\\'s message. The democracy we fashioned is intended to liberate the citizenry, to ensure that they have a platform from which they can better continue the journey to freedom, a journey that we share with all humankind. We find ourselves today filled with anxiety, anguish and anger at the machinations that invade the ANC\\'s efforts at renewal. Our anxiety is heightened because no other political formation in our country bears even the faintest promise to realise the vision in the covenant we made in 1955, the Freedom Charter. If we resolutely pursue the campaign against corruption, if we find ways to ensure service delivery happens, and if we ensure that our defence of democracy embraces the necessity to make it people-centred and participatory, we shall have set our compass right for the country.

      "DANCING THE DREAM From District Six to London\\'s Royal Ballet, world-famous ballet dancer Johaar Mosaval talks to Here he is, neat as a pin, his tiny and compact figure seems, even at 95, to be full of an energy that wants to be released as he moves his arms in balletic arcs. The almond-shaped planes of his face reveal a determination and discipline that led him to become a principal dancer at London\\'s Royal Ballet, working at the coal face of one of the hardest jobs in the world. \"I was one of 10 children. Of course, my parents, devout Muslims, were against my becoming a ballet dancer. It was during the days of apartheid and they knew nothing about ballet, added to which I was a boy,\" says Johaar Mosaval. He finally made it to the University of Cape Town (UCT) Ballet Company under Dulcie Howes, \"but I always had to be in the back row\", he says. \"I was the only boy in the class. This was during the days of apartheid and coloured boys did not become ballet dancers.\" Soon enough, people in the dancing world began to notice him. In his early 20s, he met Britain\\'s Alicia Markova, who was touring South Africa. She immediately recognised his talent and an audition was organised. Mosaval achieved top honours, ensuring him a position with Sadler\\'s Wells, a forerunner of the Royal Ballet company. Here he soon became a principal dancer, sharing the international stage with such dance icons as Britain\\'s Margot Fonteyn and Beryl Gray, and South Africa\\'s Nadia Nerina. But Mosaval always knew he had to work harder than any of the others, spurred on perhaps by Howes, who told him he would never get work in London because he was too short. \"When the others went off at tea time for a snack, I would practise. I would even practise on a Sunday and on an aeroplane,\" he laughs. Mosaval became revered for his wide-ranging styles and fluent technique, and for roles such as Jasper in Pineapple Pol and the little clown in The Lady and the Fool. At that time there were many South Africans in the Sadler\\'s Wells ballet company, particularly choreographers, and Mosaval worked with the famous John Cranko and Terence MacMillan, who he danced with for many years. \"The highlight of my career was during Queen Elizabeth II\\'s coronation celebration, which was attended by royalty and then prime minister Winston Churchill. During the interval, I was taken to meet the queen, Princess Margaret and Prince Philip. Sadly, now all passed.\" He met and danced with many of the great dancers of the day. \"I was dancing Puck in Midsummer Night\\'s Dream when Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev came to visit me in my dressing room.\" Another encounter was with famous heart-transplant surgeon Prof Chris Barnard. \"I was dancing in Coppélia, where all the toys come alive at night. I touched a doll\\'s heart as if to give it life and this struck a cord with Professor Barnard, who happened to be in the audience. When I came back to South Africa and was living with my mother, I received a letter brought by messenger. It was during apartheid and we thought it was the police. I was terrified. The letter just said: \\'Call this number.\\' I called the number and it was Chris Barnard, he said: \\'Johaar, I want to give you a big party.\\'\" At 95, Mosaval leads an ascetic life, adhering to Islamic beliefs. His biggest luxury is the occasional pepper steak. \"I live alone and my desire is to keep my independence.\" He recently renewed his driving licence and drove from his home in Lansdowne, Cape Town, to our meeting in the city centre. Like many ballet dancers, he has trouble with his feet, and has also undergone major heart surgery. \"They look after him like a jewel,\" Tina Smith, head curator at District Six Museum, tells me before going out in the rain to buy him a pepper steak which I think he\\'d been anticipating throughout our interview. Johaar returned to South Africa in 1973. \"I promised Dulcie Howes I\\'d come home to help our people,\" he says. As I left, I wanted to hug this small, adorable man who\\'s done so much for our country and culture. Mosaval will be honoured by the South African ballet and dance scene in \\'Dreaming Dance in District Six: The Johaar Mosaval Story\\'. The award-winning production takes place at the Artscape Opera House from March 2 to 4 2023.

      "Holding an audience and the performing art of retail WHEN I walk into Vida e CaffÅ for my daily fix, I\\'m expecting the Vida vibe. It\\'s the reason I go there and not next door. I look forward to seeing the barista, who\\'s a bit left of centre, but smooth and sophisticated at the same time. I\\'m anticipating some friendly banter, some witty comment on the ailing global economy while he froths up my brew. I go there because I\\'m expecting the Vida brand. I\\'m not expecting surliness, disinterest or boredom. So when I get the cold shoulder, I\\'m prepared to show them my back. Retail branding is theatre and, as a paying spectator, I\\'m willing to walk out if the production is lousy. I\\'ll also be quick to spread the word. Times are tough and when it comes to parting with my hard-earned cash, I want every aspect of the stage set, from the backdrop and the props to the lighting and the sound, to ignite my senses. Consumers are notoriously promiscuous when it comes to brand loyalty - perhaps even more so now that the recession has arrested our spending and focused our attention even more closely on value and service delivery. And in sectors where there is price and product parity, such as in fast foods and petrol stations, getting customers up close and personal with the brand experience can be the difference between winning and losing. Research suggests only 5% of consumers are loyal to the brand of one product group, while 70% of our brand selections are made in-store and 68% of our buying decisions are unplanned. Attract and capture is the driver of success. So who\\'s doing it well and what\\'s their secret? Well, given that a worker in the quick service restaurant industry has about 30 seconds to interact with the customer, speed and skill are essential. And with increasing brand convergence and price and product parity, it\\'s increasingly up to individuals at the coal face to influence consumer choice. Individual behaviour, developing relationships and customer service can be either a brand saviour or destroyer. We\\'re more likely to be loyal to a person who\\'s given us great service than we are to a product. Employee behaviour has become so important that brand specialists have turned to psychologists and behaviourists so we can better understand and develop the emotional intelligence of our clients\\' brands. Every aspect of an organisation is directed by performance against brand behaviour. Visitors to the V& A Waterfront mall in Cape Town will have noticed the new Nespresso store, prominently positioned and instantly alluring. If they\\'ve been into the store, they would have encountered brand ambassadors, who are interested and interesting, technically knowledgeable and passionate about their work. Training\\'s the big issue. From franchises to large national operations, the same principle applies. Every person in an organisation can influence how well a brand is brought to life. Customers want a fantastic brand experience - even if it\\'s \"just\" a cup of coffee on the go. At the Disney corporation, every employee, from the lowliest cleaner to the most senior manager, is recognised for their value as a brand activist and they\\'re trained equally to deliver brand Disney. The waitress at Primi Piatti is actually one of the reasons I go there - often. She\\'s just what I expect from the Primi brand: she\\'s a proud \"meeter and greeter\" and she oozes that definitive Primi attitude. For my money, it\\'s one of the best local brands because it lives up to its promise. My expectations are met, time after time. Once the stage is set, the actors need to perform. How good are South African brands at doing this? I think I\\'ll mull this over during another performance at my local Primi theatre. •Leigh is director of HKLM Group.\n",

      "High price for a safer society THE national crime statistics released by the South African Police Service (SAPS) show the downward trend remains on track. The overall number of serious crimes reported to the SAPS fell from 2,12-million cases last year to 2,07-million this year. Most encouragingly, murder has declined consistently since the advent of democracy in 1994, albeit from an horrifically high base, as have other interpersonal violent crimes, such as attempted murder and serious assault. These figures indicate that the SAPS is doing a lot right in combating crime, but they only show part of the story. In some cases, improved policing, and increased reporting of crimes, can perversely affect crime statistics. A good example of this would be the reported 4,5% increase in drunk driving. It is hard to believe that the increase in visible policing and the number of roadblocks has resulted in more drunk driving - rather, it is likely that more people who once drove drunk with impunity are now being apprehended. Furthermore, some of the figures that were released point to a displacement of crime - most notably the decrease in bank robberies and marked increase in ATM bombings. The raw percentages also need to be interrogated: the 61,5% increase in ATM bombings translates to 152 new cases, and while this is an alarming number, it is possible most are the work of a few syndicates rather than a national pandemic. It should not be forgotten, however, that at the heart of these positive crime figures lies a terrifying reality for police personnel. Although the number of policemen and women killed in the line of duty has declined slightly, the figure remains shockingly high. Since the beginning of the year, 65 officers have been killed, compared with 94 in the whole of last year and 107 in 2009. It is possible that the unacceptably high number of police deaths is also the result of more active policing but, more than anything, it shows the size of the debt of gratitude SA owes to most of the country\\'s often underappreciated law enforcement officers. A safer society and lower crime rate are not the responsibility of the police alone. To achieve further reductions, police need the support of the public, the government and judicial system. Tough policing is good, but there is an unacceptable price attached to it. Police officers at the coal face of law enforcement should be given the training, protection and respect they deserve.\n",

      "Seeing society in a pile of data like a statue in a marble block SOME time in 1984, I visited the Swedish foreign ministry. Opinion survey results showing that 74% of urban Africans opposed the disinvestment of foreign companies from SA hit the headlines while I was in Stockholm. The news was not what many people in Sweden wished to hear at a time when the campaign for the economic isolation of SA was intensifying. Who was this man Lawrence Schlemmer? I was asked about the author of the survey. Was he reliable? Well, I said, he\\'s the president of the South African Institute of Race Relations. He is also one of the top social scientists in SA and you can be sure his survey methodology is professional and his interpretations of the data painstakingly careful. This didn\\'t go down well with the Swedish officials. Perhaps, they said, the Africans in the survey didn\\'t understand the issues at stake. Funny you should say that, I replied, for the government in SA uses the same argument to deny them the vote. Though there were one or two exceptions, most subsequent surveys confirmed Schlemmer\\'s findings. Fast forward to 2001, and Schlemmer once again upset the apple cart. In a survey commissioned by the institute he found that the burning issue for the vast majority of South Africans was unemployment - not, as so many people claimed, racism. Essop Pahad, then minister in the Presidency, was having none of this. Schlemmer, he said, was simply foolish. People walked out of meetings when Schlemmer presented his findings, politically incorrect as they were at the time. But that was a key point about Schlemmer, who died last month. In a country where so many ostensible & opinion leaders& in business, academia, civil society and the media are often no more than slaves to political correctness, he was a beacon of honesty, integrity and truth. But this was only one of the reasons he was in a class of his own as a social scientist. Another was his never-ending quest for hard data based on market research. Like Michelangelo able to see a statue inside a block of marble, he could discern not merely how opinions might be moving but also much about the very nature of our society from piles of printouts. There were other reasons Schlemmer was sui generis. He seemed to know every nook and cranny of this society. As a one-time social worker, he had been at the coal face. His knowledge of SA was subtle, profound - and fascinating. And he was often able to produce facts contradicting the claims of those purporting to speak for particular constituencies. Schlemmer was not only a man of liberal convictions, but one with the pioneering spirit to act them out. Notably, in the early 1980s, he played a leading role in helping to implement Mangosuthu Buthelezi\\'s initiatives to break SA\\'s political logjam by planning for nonracial government in KwaZulu and Natal. This was at a time when few people believed negotiations on a nonracial constitution were possible. That his office and home were firebombed in 1986 testifies to how his boldness as a liberal engendered hostility on the hard left. Politically unpopular though it might have been with some, his involvement in KwaZulu and Natal was prescient. It was not long afterwards that the National Party itself recognised the future lay in negotiation. With his ear always close to the ground, Schlemmer was one of the first to discern early signs of the shift in Afrikaner thinking that eventually helped to pave the way for FW de Klerk\\'s momentous actions of February 2 1990. In 1970, 20 years before then, Schlemmer predicted that & a mellowing of Afrikaner nationalism& would help SA and its government adjust to realities at odds with its racial ideology. The initial changes would be small, but they would ultimately snowball. The next 20 years proved him right. & 8226;Kane-Berman is CE of the South African Institute of Race Relations.

      "Rule of law Disregard for constitution led to financial crisis in Limpopo THE continuing spat between PresidentJacob Zuma\\'sCabinet and the provincial executive committee of the African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo has factional political dimensions that have hogged the news headlines. But the crisis in governance in the province, which neighbours Zimbabwe in more than one way, is a matter for legal, rather than political, analysis. The system of government chosen by the South African people has been called a & quasifederal& one. This is an outcome of a compromise reached when our reunified country emerged from the negotiations for a new dispensation to replace the balkanisation policy of choice under apartheid, in which quasi-independent & homelands& were scattered about the landscape. The & quasifederal& accommodation was reached because there was no consensus on the federal system favoured by the National Party (and the Inkatha Freedom Party) and the unitary state the ANC envisaged when it came to the table to negotiate an end to the armed struggle. The nine provinces of the new SA have certain competencies parcelled out to them in the constitution itself. Schedule four to the constitution lists & functional areas of concurrent national and provincial legislative competence& while schedule five lists & functional areas of exclusive provincial legislative competence& When it comes to running provinces, the buck stops with the premiers and their provincial cabinets - they are & accountable individually and collectively to the legislature for the exercise of their powers and the performance of their functions& They may not undertake any other paid work, act in a way that is inconsistent with their office, expose themselves to the risk of a conflict of interests or use their position or any information entrusted to them to enrich themselves or to improperly benefit any other person. In their turn, the provincial legislatures are required by the constitution to provide for mechanisms to ensure that all provincial executive organs of state are accountable to them and to maintain oversight of the exercise of provincial executive authority and of any provincial organ of state. The fact that the provincial legislature in Limpopo appears to have been passive in the face of the alleged financial meltdown and effective bankruptcy (at least according to the national Cabinet\\'s assessment of the situation of the province) is remarkable. It appears that the notion that all power resides in the ANC (bruited abroad by the Limpopo provincial executive committee of the ANC) has caused constitutional amnesia that absolves the members of the provincial legislature from doing their duty and exercising their responsibilities. The party list system for their election, according to the proportional representation system in place, is to blame for the dysfunctional relationship between voters and politicians. Further, the ability of party bosses to pick and choose who gets on to, and stays on, the party list has so emasculated legislatures that their accountability and oversight functions are all too often more illusory than real. Proportional representation across the board at national and provincial levels of government comes at an unaffordable price. Even at national level, the post-arms-deals history of a supposedly nonpartisan committee such as Parliament\\'s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) does not make for illuminating reading. The executive interference in the arms deals investigations had the unfortunate effect of gutting Scopa. The role of public servants who are at the coal face of service delivery in the provinces should not be omitted in any legal analysis of the problems flowing from the intervention by the national government in the governance of Limpopo. The public service is enjoined to & loyally execute the lawful policies of the government of the day& Self-evidently, this does not include cronyism, corruption and cadre deployment in the public administration, all of which are illegal. Nor may procurement of goods and services be effected otherwise than in accordance with a system that is & fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective& These criteria are constitutionally prescribed. They are also backed up by legislation, regulations and practice manuals. Public servants are bound by the founding values of the constitution and, more specifically, by the values and principles spelt out especially for them in section 195 of the constitution. Foremost among these are a high standard of professional ethics, efficiency, transparency and accountability. & Services must be provided impartially, fairly, equitably and without bias& according to the express wording of the section. The requirements of this provision of our supreme law are all but a dead letter in Limpopo, and indeed elsewhere in SA. This makes complete and unfortunate nonsense of the last words of section two, which says: & This constitution is the supreme law of the Republic; law or conduct inconsistent with it is invalid, and the obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled& It is clear, on whichever version of the goings-on in Limpopo, that there has been conduct inconsistent with the constitution in abundance. The intervention by the national Cabinet is aimed at steadying the ship of state by addressing the effects of the alleged misconduct, malfeasance and misfeasance in the functioning of the provincial administration. It is perhaps preferable in the longer term to seek out the causes of the trouble and to address them. Lack of respect for the rule of law may feature prominently as a cause of the general malaise in Limpopo. Cadre deployment in the public administration is at the root of much of the trouble, and it, in and of itself, is an illegal practice. It is certainly not a & good human resource management and career development& practice, as laid down in section 195(1) of the constitution. The national intervention, although sanctioned by the constitution, is not necessarily the cure to the problems that allegedly exist. The Cabinet announcement is particularly vague about which of the provisions of section 100(1) (b) apply, although it does seem apparent from the nature of the intervention that the plan is to & prevent that province from taking unreasonable action that is prejudicial to the interests ... of the country as a whole& as the section puts it. Certainly, it would be prejudicial to allow Limpopo to wallow in its alleged insolvency or simply to throw good money after bad without any prospect of improvement in the situation on the ground and in the stability of the finances of the province. Whatever transpires in the faction fighting, all of the adversaries would do well to consider the legal framework within which they are meant to operate. It is not helpful to cry foul on the basis that others are doing the same and getting away with it. If there has been wrongdoing, it needs to be addressed with the full might of the law. Nor does it assist to single out a political adversary in a faction fight for & special treatment& when equality before the law is foundational to our democratic dispensation. All wrongdoing, irrespective of the province or the faction in which it occurs, should be addressed if the rule of law is to survive. & 8226;Hoffman SC is a director of the Institute for Accountability in Southern Africa. \\'When it comes to running provinces, the buck stops with the premiers and their provincial cabinets\\'\n",

      "Changes afoot at the coalface of labour relations Doing nothing makes Zuma an accessory SOMETHING really dramatic is taking place at grassroots level in SA\\'s labour relations that could reshape both the labour environment and politics in SA. The tip of the iceberg is visible at Impala Platinum, which could soon become the first major segment of the mining industry to oust the Congress of South African Trade Unions\\' (Cosatu\\'s) largest affiliate, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). But perhaps the most unrecognised aspect of this new environment is the role played by SA\\'s labour legislation, which has always been a general problem, but now threatens to become a specific problem for a whole new set of reasons. How important the developments at Impala will turn out to be remains difficult to answer, but they are dramatic enough to warrant a much closer look than they are getting at the moment. Impala has already lost 120000oz and about R2,4bn in the strike in March. The new wildcat strike, now over, this week cost it another 6000oz. For shareholders, the industry has been a pretty miserable investment, although Impala has not fallen dramatically out of proportion with its megarival Anglo American Platinum, and a lot less than Lonmin and Aquarius. The share price of both the big players are 25% down over a one-year period, more or less in line with the big diversified miners. It doesn\\'t help that labour relations at the mines have been very troubled. Remember, this is the industry that has been earmarked as base of SA\\'s industrial rebound. The repeated & unprotected& strikes at Impala invite a whole range of questions. Why Impala? Why the platinum industry? Why now? Broadly speaking, the answers lie in the interplay between the changing character of Cosatu, the essential conception of SA\\'s labour legislation, and the changing nature of South African society. Impala has been at the vortex of these problems, which have a good chance of spreading. All of these contesting forces led to an unusual development at Impala this past week: a decision to verify the claim by the NUM\\'s rival, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), that it represents the majority of the roughly 20000-person workforce. If Amcu\\'s claim is true, it will be the first major inroad into Cosatu\\'s dominant position since democracy. In itself, the change will not be dramatic for the NUM, which claims about 300000 members. But symbolically, it may herald a new phase. Amcu has been active for a number of years, but only recently has it seen its membership surge in an industry. Why platinum has been so successful is hard to know. Poor leadership from the NUM could be a factor. Traditionally, the NUM president handles the gold and the coal portfolios, and the deputy president handles platinum and the smaller sectors. The current deputy president is Piet Matosa, seen by platinum shop stewards and workers as a Cosatu head office appointee. He was attacked at an Impala mine three years ago, and he unfortunately lost an eye. His position was contested at the NUM congress this weekend, although he managed to face down the challenge. But another problem has to do with the nature of platinum mining. Unusually, the industry is strongly weighted towards the lower levels of the salary hierarchy. With the end of job reservation and the gradual elevation of NUM members up the skills and pay scale, shop stewards have been selected from this small core of better paid workers. As society has changed, the distance now between this select band of senior employees and base-level employees is pretty marked for the first time. Amcu is a much less sophisticated union, much more inclined to bypass the Labour Relations Act and go on unauthorised strikes, as we have seen this year. Its representatives come out of the base of the salary structure, and therefore presumably have a better connection with the largest part of the workforce. They have a much more intense focus on workplace matters, and there is some feeling the NUM is distant, focused on political issues, and NUM leaders are out for themselves in the world of politics. Whatever the reasons, Amcu now needs to be taken seriously. This is where the legislative environment becomes an issue. The Labour Relations Act was passed in 1995, to bring labour legislation in line with the new constitution. Less recognised was its role as a big & thank you& from the ANC to Cosatu. The legislation didn\\'t stop at formalising the right to strike as the constitution required, it also weighted the labour relations balance heavily in favour of labour - something recognised only at that point by the diminutive Democratic Party. It did so by introducing mechanisms such as the closed shop and the agency shop, which forces workers to join the majority union and which allows the union to charge all workers membership fees. It\\'s a little known fact that legislation allows a company to fire an employee who refuses to join a union with which it has a closed shop relationship. The legislation is the major cause of SA\\'s sclerotic labour market and the big reason it has been steadily declining in world competitiveness surveys. What is relevant is the extent to which the legislation favours majoritarianism. The concept behind the legislation is that there will be one, big union in every industry, and the strategy was intended to create a situation in which Cosatu particularly would rule the roost. It was assumed that this would help to create labour peace and that Cosatu would always be the moderate, reasonable, well-led organisation it was in the early 1990s. It was assumed Cosatu could be relied on not to become belligerent, and that labour relations would improve in this majority-favouring environment. However, the opposite has happened; working days lost to strikes are reaching extreme levels, and the huge power bestowed on Cosatu has turned into a political nightmare for the ANC, which Cosatu now leads by the nose. For aspirant unions outside Cosatu, the result is a Game of Thrones scenario; you have only one way to win, and that is to deliver a knock-out blow. Impala\\'s current position is telling; it is legally obliged to ignore the representatives of the majority of its workforce and negotiate with the union representing a small slice. The process of de-recognising the NUM and recognising Amcu will take months, if it happens at all. Another factor is competition between unions, and here the politics will also to be tough. Many mining operations include smelting and other industrial operations. As a result, there appears to be more competition for support between the Zuma-supporting NUM and the more ambivalent National Union of Metalworkers of SA. How this plays out will be interesting. Overall, it may the premature to declare a new, difficult phase of labour relations in SA. But the early fault lines are definitely visible. I\\'VE written several times about my problems with the Brics concept, so it\\'s refreshing to see alternative views. One of the most interesting is the book Breakout Nations by Ruchir Sharma. The Bric nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China) idea seems too closely wedded to straight-line extrapolation, often expressed in the year China will overtake the US as the world\\'s biggest economy. Sharma\\'s put-down of this idea is telling: & As much as we all love the speculative titillation of futurology, no one can forecast the next century with any credibility and, more importantly, be held accountable for it,& he writes. Instead, he says, each country should be examined for its own specific characteristics. He also focuses less on the race in absolute gross domestic product (GDP) and more on GDP per capita. GDP size is a completely spurious measure when it comes to economic wellbeing, because countries with large populations have an obvious cumulative advantage. GDP per capita is the more comparable measure, and more inclusive. Actually, it turns out the next wave of & breakout nations& may not include any of the Brics, he says. China is slowing, its malls are empty and its labour market competitiveness is eroding. China\\'s growth is very dependent on the cheap money policies of first world nations. India\\'s tiny GDP per capita means it should easily outpace the rest of the world, but he says India has many other weaknesses. He hardly has time for Russia and Brazil, which he sees as functions of commodity markets. The real breakouts will be South Korea, Indonesia, the Czech Republic, Poland and possibly Turkey. And SA? SA, he says, is stuck in a kind of time warp. During apartheid, SA developed one of the most top-heavy forms of capitalism, with much of the economy under state control and the rest in hands of a few dominant cartels. The ANC kept that basic structure, with itself now the dominant ruling party, & backed by its allies in perhaps the most powerful union movement in the developing world. None of these power centres - not the state, not the private companies, not the ANC or its union allies - seems to have much sense of urgency about ramping growth.& Pretty spot on, I think. OUTSIDE this huge debate about youth wage subsidies and freedom to paint private parts, one small thing really irks me. Taking questions in Parliament, which most democratic leaders do fairly regularly but which in SA only seems to happen twice a year, President Jacob Zuma was predictably asked about police crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli. Zuma\\'s reply was that Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa had appointed a task team to investigate aspects of this matter, while the inspector-general of intelligence was also probing aspects within her mandate. & Everything possible was being done to address the matter,& he said. But the appointments, suspensions, reinstatements, transfers, in government departments were the responsibility of those departments & and not the president& He takes the same & I wash my hands& approach to a host of other issues, including analyst Moeletsi Mbeki\\'s criticism at the weekend, citing & procedure& But if there is illegality involved, then for pity\\'s sake, it\\'s absolutely up to him to get stuck in, and damn quickly too. It should be axiomatic that you can\\'t steal money from taxpayers by hiring your mates to do nothing. He needs to demonstrate unequivocally this is unacceptable behaviour, because if he doesn\\'t he is effectively encouraging it and is effectively an accessory.

      "Another week of transport strike will take toll on business Economics correspondent SHOULD the strike by transport workers enter a third week, the effect on businesses, business confidence, as well as consumers will worsen, South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Neren Rau cautioned in an interview yesterday. His comments followed the release of a weakened business confidence indicator by the business grouping. Mr Rau said current reports from the chamber\\'s small and medium-sized businesses were of shortages at fuel stations and cash machines, primarily in Gauteng. & If the strike continues, we\\'re going to experience reports of trading disruptions. If it extends to four weeks, we would start to be concerned about the GDP (gross domestic product) impact,& he said. Some 20,000 road freight industry workers are on a wage strike that started almost two weeks ago. Truck drivers, most of whom are affiliated to the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union, want a 12% salary increase while employers have offered 8.5% effective from March. Yesterday, the South African Municipal Workers Union said a march by 5,000 council workers in Limpopo tomorrow will be a precursor to national protest action over wage parity and against corruption in local government. Public service workers have not downed tools this year, despite wage negotiations at local and provincial levels. Public sector strikes are generally the most disruptive, particularly in the municipal sector, the coal face of service delivery. Municipal worker unions and the South African Local Government Association are involved in a protracted legal battle over the implementation of a wage curve in the local government sector. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant yesterday addressed the transport workers\\' negotiators. Although the strike has so far involved less violence than that seen on platinum mines in August, sporadic incidences of property damage by strikers have been reported. However, analysts believe the transport strike has the potential to become more damaging than the industrial action in the platinum sector mainly due to its close links to other sectors. & Even though the mining strike was severe, it was mainly in platinum. The transport strike affects all sectors of the economy and could have a much worse effect on economic growth, depending on how long it lasts,& said Marina Willemse, economist at Efficient Group. & But we must note that we haven\\'t yet really seen productive sectors being severely affected.& Ms Willemse said they were already forecasting lower growth in the third quarter following the work stoppages during the quarter. & We see economic growth at 2% in the third quarter,& she said. The business formation raises these concerns amid declining business confidence levels mainly due to the global economic slowdown, and partly due to work stoppages caused by strikes, which together weigh heavily on business sentiment. The chamber\\'s business confidence index fell to 91.7 points last month from 95.0 in August. & This is deeply concerning. The BCI (business confidence index) is not finding its path towards the critical level of 100,& Mr Rau said. With Natasha Marrian\n",

      "Stolen data used to nail you Revenue authorities happy to use purloined bank information to target tax evaders Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr BANK secrecy has recently been in the news all over the world and global changes relating to bank secrecy will accelerate and could especially have an impact on the high net worth individual constituency. South Africans in that category should take note. Unfortunately the theoretical (read statutory) foundation of banking secrecy and how things pan out in real life are often very different - as high net worth individuals on both sides of the Atlantic can attest to. Data theft by bank employees and the buying of data by revenue authorities has seemingly become a fast-growing international sport where the prize money could be staggering. So expect the & sport& to attract newcomers and to make banks internationally shiver in their collective boots. It seems that bank data - however obtained - will increasingly inform and direct revenue authorities\\' compliance actions. The South African legal position regarding bank secrecy was analysed in a case where a South African big-four bank took on Noseweek magazine in FirstRand Bank Ltd v Chaucer Publications (Pty) Ltd 2008(2) SA 592 (CPD). Judge Traverso pointed out that a banker\\'s contractual obligation to preserve the confidentiality of its client\\'s banking affairs had long been recognised in English law (Tournier v National Provincial & Union Bank of England [1924] 1 KB 461). It was a qualified legal right arising from a contract. Locally, a banker\\'s duty of confidentiality had been recognised as early as 1914. Judge Traverso concluded: & It seems to me that for considerations of public policy the relationship between a bank and its client must be of a confidential nature. Equally - for considerations of public policy - this duty is subject to being overridden by a greater public interest.& She also noted that, although the duty not to disclose rests with the bank, the privilege not to have the details of the dealings with the bank disclosed belonged to the client. It was therefore the client alone who could invoke this privilege and insist on the bank keeping its client\\'s information confidential. But often there is a disconnect between what the law says and what happens at the coal face. The theft of confidential bank data and the on-selling of it to revenue authorities is big business these days. A & gold mine& of data stolen from the LGT bank (owned by the Lichtenstein royal family) during 2008 found its way to the German tax authorities via an LGT employee, who received €4.2m. The data was used, among other things, to convict the CEO of Deutsche Post of tax evasion. Germany\\'s Constitutional Court expressly ruled that such stolen data could be used in further tax probes: & The constitution knows no rules saying that a legally flawed collection of evidence in any case bars the use of that evidence.& In February 2010, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia bought stolen discs containing the names of approximately 1,500 German account holders with Swiss bank Credit Suisse. Despite criticism, the UK Revenue and Customs authority immediately approached Berlin to purchase the stolen data in order to detect potential UK tax evaders with hidden Swiss accounts. The Dutch, Belgian and Austrian governments also showed strong buying interest. In October 2010, the man suspected of the Swiss data theft (and who allegedly got €2.5m for it), but was arrested by Swiss authorities for the theft, was found dead in his prison cell. Police said it looked like suicide. As recently as late August this year Swiss private bank Julius Baer confirmed that it had discovered a & case of data misuse& The bank said that a Zurich employee acted alone and had been arrested. The thief had been paid & an undisclosed sum& by the German tax authorities. The amounts paid by revenue authorities to bank data thieves in Europe are paltry compared to what the IRS has on offer in the US. Under the IRS whistle-blower regime, an informant could potentially collect up to 30% of the proceeds in instances where the amount in dispute exceeds $2m. On September 11 2012, it was announced that the IRS had paid $104m (approximately R820m) to one Bradley Birkenfeld who earlier supplied the IRS with in-depth information on how Swiss bank UBS had helped US clients to evade tax. According to Birkenfeld\\'s lawyers it could be the largest pay-out ever to a single whistle-blower. The award by the IRS followed Birkenfeld\\'s exceptional cooperation and took into account the extensive information he gave on the UBS tax-fraud scheme. Birkenfeld\\'s offering to the IRS was used during 2009 to strong-arm UBS into a $780m settlement with the IRS. (Incidentally, as a UBS private banker, Birkenfeld once smuggled diamonds into the US by concealing them in toothpaste. This was the exceptional service UBS high-value customers received. He served three years jail for his role in the UBS tax fraud scheme but indicated that he will seek a presidential pardon.) The OECD published a report on October 26 2011 entitled: The Era of Bank Secrecy is Over. The first sentence reads: & In April 2009, G20 leaders took action to end the era of bank secrecy.& The OECD must be smiling at the support its efforts at destroying bank secrecy have been getting from banking insiders who have access to sensitive client data. Of course the banks are not doing themselves any favours: HSBC\\'s large-scale money laundering on behalf of cocaine cartels was documented in a mid-July US Senate report. That will mean more pressure on banks everywhere. The chairman of the Senate Committee already said & ultimately, the rest of us are forced to pay more on our tax bills to make up for those who shirk their taxpaying responsibilities& Locally, information provided by South African banks to the South African Revenue Service (SARS) as & third-party data& features as an important cog in SARS\\'s compliance plan. The SARS Annual Report says: & The use of third party data to verify self-assessments by taxpayers and to perform risk-profiling is a growing trend in international tax administration.& Sources of third party data range from financial institutions, employers, credit bureaus to other government agencies like the Department of Home Affairs. Going forward revenue authorities will increase their attacks on bank secrecy. Banks will see ever-widening and invasive information requests. The treasure troves of bank data have been prised open with help from bank employees eyeing lucrative whistle-blower pay-outs. Legal precedent telling bank clients that bank secrecy is alive and well, and should be respected (by revenue authorities as well), is unfortunately only part of the story.

      "Medium-term budget policy statement debate Summit TV takes a look at Pravin Gordhan\\'s medium-term budget policy statement with a panel of experts, and the need for South Africa can prevent an \\'Arab Spring\\' Summit Transcripts Services. 26 October 2012 SHESHI Kaniki is a senior economist at Momentum; Prof Steven Friedman is a director at the Centre for the Study of Democracy; Adam Habib is a political analyst and deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Johannesburg; and Krister Janse van Rensburg is deputy general secretary at union federation Fedusa. SUMMIT TV: What does the medium-term budget policy statement (MTBPS) mean to you and your investments? South Africa has revised revenue collection projections downwards for the first time, but Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan tried to depict a sound trajectory - though some are sceptical that he can make up for lower tax collection by reining in spending and maladministration by municipalities as promised. Sheshi, something we were not expecting was the downward revision in revenue collection... SHESHI KANIKI: Yes, that\\'s definitely historic - but with current domestic and global conditions not entirely unexpected. We are not growing anywhere near where we need to be - the minister projected growth of around 2.5% this year, down from 3% last year. Clearly the economic climate is not conducive to revenue generation hence the downward revision of R5bn to the fiscus. STV: It\\'s quite sobering... ADAM HABIB: I think it\\'s a financially prudent budget - but given our development needs I\\'m worried about that. Having said that, we couldn\\'t have had anything more radical. I think given the context of both global conditions, with the slowdown in Europe, and in particular the recent mining strikes and the impact of these strikes, it\\'s a very reasonable budget. What worried me more was the actual commentary, where I thought Tim Harris from the Democratic Alliance was particularly wrong when he compared the National Development Plan (NDP) to the New Growth Path (NGP). I think the biggest challenge in South Africa is inequality, where the mining strikes are a symptom of that. I think the & Marie-Antoinesque& attitude of the Democratic Alliance and the many private-sector economists on inequality and its impacts is a danger in our society and I think we need to take it more seriously than they do. STV: Interesting, because the minister, in his delivery of the MTBPS, did say that the crisis in the mining sector means we need a new social contract... ADAM HABIB: He did, and I do think we need that. What we often forget is the social compact is not simply labour giving everything - it does require political and economic elites and corporates to say, & This is what we are prepared to put on the table....& When I listen to private-sector economists I never hear them saying what sacrifices are going to be made by the corporate sector - all I hear is & we want deregulation of the labour market& and & we want labour to make concessions& That\\'s what I describe as the & Marie-Antoinesque& attitude - a complete ignorance of the dangers of inequality. I often say that our economists need a good dose of Sociology 101... STV: Steven, when we saw the downgrades by the ratings agencies Standard & Poor\\'s and Moody\\'s and the minister returned from Hong Kong, he seemed rather shocked - there was a tone that needed to be set and a message saying & we are still on the same fiscal trajectory& and & we have an appreciation of what our problems are...& STEVEN FRIEDMAN: I don\\'t think he was shocked - he may have appeared shocked but certainly in the discussions I had, the Treasury people expected this. I think he was perfectly entitled to challenge the decision because I think it was based on a particular set of phobias about what is happening in this country. Following from Adam\\'s point, one needs to remember that ratings agencies don\\'t get this stuff out of a bubble - they get speak to a lot of businesspeople. In effect what we are hearing from the ratings agencies is the negative business sentiment here being played back to us. Yes, you are absolutely right - he had to send the message he did, and it was an appropriate message in that sense because Adam\\'s points about inequality are well taken. If you compare the numbers we\\'ve heard and the hysteria we are seeing in the media, there isn\\'t much relation there. We are a country with major poverty and inequality problems - our problem is not wild government spending. I think having said that, the minister and the country\\'s problem is that he can stabilise the budget but dealing with the problems is not for the minister of finance. STV: A lot is put on two institutions in South Africa, the National Treasury and the Reserve Bank - where all they can do is work within the framework of the law. If other departments are not doing what they need to do, there isn\\'t much that they can do about it - are we putting too much pressure on them? KRISTER JANSE VAN RENSBURG: One often gets the feeling that Treasury is a pocket of excellence that government wants to put in the display window to show that everything is okay. As Adam said earlier it\\'s used maybe to a certain extent wrongly - or maybe rightly so to boost investor confidence. That\\'s one way we can show post-1994 through GEAR (growth, employment and redistribution) and the RDP (reconstruction and development) and all the interventions that we still have sound monetary policy and sound fiscal policy. I think the aim is to show Treasury is doing its job; however, whether they can steer political agendas is something else. STV: After the budget we heard & balanced& and & realistic& and & stable& which were calming words but is this enough to calm the nerves of those who may be looking at us today? KRISTER JANSE VAN RENSBURG: I think so. Balanced is a good word and it is very balanced but that can also be called & uninspiring& or even & boring& We could maybe do more. There is nothing exciting and what is worrying to us and our comrades in the labour movement is that maybe there is something coming in the budget speech next year... STV: What more do you expect? KRISTER JANSE VAN RENSBURG: We saw Minster Gordhan being very quiet about things like retirement reform, which is a burning issue at the moment, as well as the youth wage subsidy. Those things were brushed aside - we didn\\'t hear anything about that. National health insurance, as we all know, is causing concern around how that revenue is going to be generated to pay for it. STV: Another thing that wasn\\'t detailed was the infrastructure plan - we still don\\'t have detail about what role the private sector is going to play, are there going to be public private partnerships, and how it\\'s going to be funded given people are looking at South Africa when it comes to raising the debt... SHESHI KANIKI: Yes, I\\'d agree we\\'d have liked to see more about what\\'s coming. The minister intentionally took a very narrow view with what he was trying to communicate and the message for me was one of trying to say that Treasury has its eye on the ball as far as the fiscus is concerned in light of the downgrades and sociopolitical tensions we are currently experiencing. It was an extremely narrow view and I was also surprised to see no real mention of households and the fact that we are between a rock and a hard place and something along the lines of & this is the type of relief that will be required to keep the deficit at this level& so I thought Treasury had a very clear motive to allay fears around the credit rating and fiscal management. STV: A tweet said & at least he didn\\'t tell us to tighten our belts...& Treasury has a lot of balls to juggle.... Adam, it often feels as if Treasury, particularly around mini-budget time, is being pulled from all directions, juggling a lot of balls in the air, and that it\\'s always about what is the climate at the time the speech is being delivered which decides the tone. ADAM HABIB: This was the MTBPS so I didn\\'t expect more - especially given the context where they went out with a particular message. I think they were saying very clearly & we are not in a terminal crisis& and that Pravin Gordhan berated the ratings agencies, and he did that well. I think he said very clearly & you made your judgments on political variables - but you\\'re not particularly qualified to speak about those& and that they misunderstood the policy debates and how those play themselves out. I think that was effectively the message. What\\'s also important to note is that there are three or four state pillars that deal with economic policy and the purpose of Treasury has always been regarded by the constitution as managing the fiscal processes and it\\'s not meant to lead on economic policy. Often you will hear people grumbling that & Treasury is not leading on economic policy& but that\\'s not what the constitution expects it to do. It\\'s expected to look at the fiscal questions. What we need to see is that Treasury has done its part, now we need to see Economic Policy (sic) lead in terms of the social pact and we need the political elites to take that seriously. Yes, on the one hand you want to look at remuneration limits - but on the other hand you also have to contain expenditure on Nkandla homesteads and at the same time I want to see chief executives say they are willing to do this. I would like private-sector economists saying inequality is important to deal with - because as long as they don\\'t deal with this we are in serious trouble. Often the economists complain about Julius Malema but they sound like the tea party in the USA. We are not mainstream by global standards - they need to come on board in terms of what South Africa\\'s challenges are, and what we need to do at this historical moment. If we don\\'t do that, in 10 or 15 years this country will burn because we didn\\'t take the demands of poor people seriously. SHESHI KANIKI: As a private-sector economist the comment is well received - I can only speak for our particular context where we are trying to grapple with these particular issues much more holistically, creating shared value and championing the idea that we as the corporate sector cannot continue to exist almost in a bubble, that we need to start to see ourselves as a much more integral part of society as a whole and create value not just for shareholders but for the broader society. It\\'s an important comment and the issue of inequality that Adam raises is one of the fundamental challenges facing South Africa. In the long run business has to be involved in addressing that issue. STV: The minister spent some time on the NDP talking about the role that could play in unblocking some of the structural constraints South Africa faces, but as you know whenever that is brought up the opposition cries foul and says it\\'s never going to be implemented - but it has been signed off by Cabinet... STEVEN FRIEDMAN: The social pact is absolutely crucial and in that context I\\'m fascinated by the responses to the NDP - a lot of businesspeople have elevated the 440-page document, which has all sorts of proposals, and is a mixed bag and a basis for negotiation - they\\'ve elevated it into some kind of stone tablet where most of the people doing that haven\\'t read it. When the president goes to an agricultural summit and suggests one of the proposals in the NDP he gets accused of trying to destroy commercial agriculture. People have to be consistent. We are not going to get out of our economic problems in South Africa unless there are compromises between the major economic players but how can that happen if people trash every proposal that is made? If you don\\'t like a proposal, come up with alternatives. This environment we are in at the moment, where there are constant suggestions that government has to somehow produce a miracle - there is a lot wrong in government at the moment but unless businesspeople start treating the proposals on their merits, we are not going to make progress. One other point I want to make that we have to be concerned about is we could do quite a bit with poverty and inequality in South Africa with the current fiscal constraints we have, but then we have to look at how responsive government is to people and how effective it is at getting services to people. That is going to be a major focus in the period ahead because everything the minister said is entirely possible within the constraints of the budget if we have responsive government and they listen to poor people and citizens. STV: One thing the minister spoke about was strengthening municipal finances at the coal face of service delivery... KRISTER JANSE VAN RENSBURG: There are municipal problems - we saw the auditor-general\\'s report a while back - but it is very concerning they are not delivering. There are big problems with skills and people not having qualifications. The service delivery protests are not aimed at national government but at municipal government so we need to address that.\n",

      "Strike looms as municipal negotiations falter Political Editor MUNICIPAL workers\\' unions yesterday warned of a looming strike in the sector after talks on a collective agreement collapsed. Municipal workers are at the coal face of service delivery, with strikes in the sector generally characterised by uncollected refuse littering cities and towns. Year-long talks between the South African Local Government Association (Salga) on the one hand, and the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) and the Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (Imatu) on the other, deadlocked this week. The agreement in question was meant to centre on issues including conditions of service, dispute resolution, discipline and time off for shop stewards. Salga executive director Rio Nolutshungu said the talks could not proceed as the unions wanted to broaden the mandate of negotiations. The unions wanted the scope of the agreement to include companies linked to municipalities such as Pikitup and City Power. They further wanted municipalities to administer services provided by companies with which they made agreements, such as those offering short-term loans to employees. But Mr Nolutshungu said that would violate existing legislation and increase the administrative burden on municipalities. Union dealings with companies providing services to their members was not the business of municipalities. The employer was responsible only for deducting stop orders from union members for union fees. & They want us to grant them rights to include when they have a scheme initiated with a third party, they can operationalise that scheme from our side,& he said. Salga was hoping to have & one-on-one& discussions with unions outside the bargaining council in order to persuade them to return to the negotiating table. Samwu general secretary Walter Theledi said that Salga was negotiating in bad faith and had no intention of concluding a new agreement with the unions. The main collective agreement for the sector was signed in 2003. & The material conditions on the ground necessitated our submission on the improvement of conditions of service,& Mr Theledi said. & Our submission was responded to with arrogance from the employer body without any justification.& Salga had frustrated the talks by & refusing to make any concessions& when parties to a negotiation were expected & to give and take& Samwu declared a dispute after talks collapsed on Tuesday. The unions were canvassing the opinion of their members to determine whether to down tools. & Municipal workers may decide to embark on industrial action over this matter,& said Mr Theledi. Imatu deputy general secretary Craig Adams said negotiations had proved & exceptionally frustrating& for the trade union. & Imatu has gone to great length to motivate and justify all of our proposals, yet we are being met with unsubstantiated resistance.& Imatu was exploring its options. These might include referring the matter for arbitration. But Imatu had also not ruled out striking, Mr Adams said. Salga and both unions have been at odds over a long-standing wage curve deal. Salga had rejected a facilitator\\'s proposal on ending the lack of uniformity in the remuneration of municipal workers, Samwu said earlier this month. Unions want Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Richard Baloyi to intervene in the dispute with Salga.\n",

      "From South African pioneer to world beater The company prides itself on its ability to change and adapt, which has contributed to its durability over the past century and more THE Barloworld story is one of determination, endurance and integrity, a tale of a company that has remained true to its culture and values for 110 years through many challenges, changes, ups and downs, and numerous highlights. From humble beginnings selling woollen goods in Durban, Barloworld\\'s skilled, passionate and pioneering people have built a rich heritage that is encapsulated in doing business the & Barloworld way& \"One of the things that have allowed us to be around for 110 years is our ability to change and adapt,& says Barloworld CEO Clive Thomson. In 2007 Barloworld undertook a significant restructure that saw PPC and Coatings (Plascon Paints), two of its major subsidiaries, unbundled from the group as standalone listed entities and two other significant businesses were sold. The company repositioned from eight divisions to four and in the process refocused on its traditional core distribution businesses with an offering that includes integrated product support, rental and logistics solutions. The global financial crisis followed soon after the restructuring. Barloworld\\'s resilience through this period - and the uncertain times that followed - has proven the wisdom of this decision to focus on core capabilities. & Our philosophy in recent years has been articulated in terms of value-based management, which recognises the importance of driving value creation for all our stakeholders. These stakeholders include our shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and principals (in our case Caterpillar, Hyster, leading motor vehicle manufacturers and Avis, among others) as well as the broader communities in which we operate, and our environment,& Thomson explains. & Whether we are delivering unique customer solutions, forming long-term partnerships, engaging the societies we work in through our various transformation and CSI initiatives, satisfying our shareholders through our approach to financial returns and profitable growth interventions, or developing our employees, value creation remains the backbone of our business.& In 2010 the group set its bold Vision 2015³, which aims to deliver significant incremental value for all stakeholders through 2015. The company is making significant progress towards achieving this objective through its core divisions, Equipment, Handling, and Automotive & Logistics. The Equipment division sells and supports Caterpillar mining, earthmoving and power generation products, while Handling represents mainly Hyster and agricultural brands including Massey Ferguson. It also represents the Chinese-manufactured range of SEM earthmoving products. Automotive represents various motor vehicle manufacturers, together with fleet management and car rental services through the Avis brand, and integrated supply chain solutions through its Logistics arm. Six strategic focus areas, integrated customer solutions, people, empowerment and transformation, sustainable development, financial returns and profitable growth, supported by appropriate action plans and performance indicators, align purpose and ensure common priorities through the group. These focus areas are combined to drive the group\\'s success across its divisions, while identified strategic growth segments - mining, infrastructure, power, automotive, logistics and agriculture - provide an exciting platform for Barloworld\\'s continued growth into the future. Given the global leading brands that it represents and its geographic footprint across 26 countries and four continents, Barloworld is well positioned to prosper in these growth segments. & Our 2012 financial year was a successful year in which we pursued various strategic initiatives that positioned the business for growth and we continued the process of redeploying capital into higher return opportunities,& says Thomson. Barloworld acquired the Bucyrus distribution and support businesses from Caterpillar in southern Africa and Russia, providing the group with the most extensive range of surface and underground mining products in the industry. A number of niche acquisitions were made in the Automotive division, including Avis Coach Charter and a fuel management company. Toyota and Volkswagen dealerships were opened in Soweto. By integrating its Logistics business into the Automotive division, Barloworld was able to leverage synergies and drive profitable growth. The acquisition of a specialised chemical transporter, formation of a joint venture with Manline, and the purchase of the 25% minority in Logistics Africa positioned this business to continue on its aggressive growth path. In the Handling division, the US and UK handling businesses were sold to enable cash to be redeployed into higher returning opportunities and the agricultural business was expanded in Siberia, western Russia and Mozambique. The group never loses sight of the fact that its success is driven by people and, in line with this strategic focus area, devotes significant attention to attracting, developing and retaining the talented employees required to deliver its objectives. & It\\'s the people who make the company. You can have the best brands in the world; at the end of the day it is the people who drive the success. The people at the top set the tone and those at the coalface make things happen,& says Thomson. Barloworld\\'s people have developed a pioneering spirit that enables them to endure some of the harshest conditions as they go about their work. & For them it is part of creating something special. They become professional pioneers... it\\'s what inspires them,& Thomson points out. & It\\'s this \\'frontier\\' attitude coupled with strong values that has helped the company move into places as far flung as Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Magadan in the Russian Far East. The people who work in this organisation see the challenges as opportunities rather than as negatives.& This commitment has also resulted in Barloworld sharing a more than 85-year partnership with Caterpillar, the world\\'s leading earthmoving equipment manufacturer, as well as very long-term relationships with a number of its other key principals. Other central aspects of the group\\'s value creation activities are continuously building employee diversity as well as effective stakeholder engagement. It all began back when Ernest (Billy) Barlow found himself in South Africa during the Boer War of 1899-1902. After the war he borrowed £1,000 to found Thomas Barlow & Sons in Durban. In 1927 his son, Punch Barlow, went to the US and negotiated the rights to the Caterpillar dealership. Legend has it that Punch sold the first Cat tractor in South Africa after winning a bet that a tractor could plough faster than a span of oxen. Barloworld\\'s recognised leadership in skills development has its roots in the vision of Punch Barlow, a legendary leader who believed that Barlow\\'s, as the company became known, should have an educated, motivated, loyal workforce where people would be recognised. If not, the company would not earn their loyalty. That ethos became entrenched in Barlows and was carried on by subsequent leaders in the group. & Punch Barlow was interested in people and the way people developed. Here at Barloworld one feels that you are part of a family,& says Thomson. & That partly explains our durability. Most listed companies are said to have an average life of around 30 years - we\\'ve already gone beyond a century. The culture of our people is competitive - we like to win, we work hard, we\\'re determined - but at the same time we conduct business in an ethical way. It stems from Punch Barlow\\'s days, and you still hear people talking about \\'our word is our bond\\'.& After the purchase of Rand Mines, the company was renamed Barlow Rand and, by the late 1980s, became the largest industrial company in South Africa and one of the Fortune 500\\'s biggest global companies. As a leading corporate committed to a sustainable future, the company played a meaningful role in contributing to the transition to democracy in South Africa. & As always, our leadership was cognisant of the need for change and evolved its strategy in line with the increasing shift in focus away from diversified conglomerates to a focus on core businesses. In 1993 the company unbundled a number of businesses. Rand Mines, Reunert and CG Smith - incorporating Tiger Brands, Illovo Sugar, Adcock Ingram Pharmaceuticals and Nampak - were spun-off,& explains Thomson. & In 2000 Barlows changed its name to Barloworld and the further restructuring in 2007 positioned the group into what we are today, a focused multinational distribution business.& Barloworld lives by its values of Integrity, Excellence, Teamwork and Commitment. The & Barloworld way& of doing business means doing what is right, now and in the future, acting in the best interests of all its stakeholders to create a sustainable future for its business, for the societies in which it operates, and for the environment. & Our success is based on our philosophy of multi-stakeholder value creation. We are proud of our reputation for integrity and excellence and the high ethical standards to which we hold ourselves accountable,& says Thomson. & We continue to build on the strong foundation set by our founders and past leaders and we take responsibility for protecting the legacy of the past, generating exceptional performance today and building a future that is sustainable. We are inspired to make a positive contribution towards creating a better world for future generations,& observes Thomson. & Barloworld is a durable organisation with a rich heritage; its people work together to make the ordinary extraordinary.& Thomas Barlow & Sons\\' head office. An independent company based on the family business of the same name in England, it was founded by Ernest Barlow in 1902 in Durban, South Africa.Bottom: Punch Barlow, the eldest son of the founder, joined the company in the 1920s and spearheaded a move into selling Caterpillar tractors.

      "Civil society Manners a good start in striving for \\'unity in diversity\\' MANNERS maketh the man,& an aphorism coined by William of Wykeham more than 600 years ago, is the motto of Winchester College and New College, Oxford, to this day. Recent events in the political and social discourse in SA, and in litigation of a public-interest nature, have brought the status of civility in our society to the fore. Any nation that strives to be united in its diversity, as ours aspires to do, and is aimed at creating circumstances in which the promotion of human dignity, the achievement of equality and the enjoyment of the various freedoms guaranteed in the Bill of Rights are goals, ought to invest heavily in its manners. & Minding p\\'s and q\\'s& as our mothers taught us to do, is the surest way to & healing the divisions of the past& as envisaged in the preamble to the constitution. Tolerance and respect ought to be the watchwords. It is therefore a welcome development that the Speaker of Parliament, Max Sisulu, has insisted on apologies from two MPs who set a poor example of mannerly conduct in their interactions with the leader of the opposition, Lindiwe Mazibuko, whose size and fashion sense were attacked in rather puerile ways. As for the unseemly spat between the South African Students\\' Congress and Julius Malema\\'s Economic Freedom Fighters, the less said the better. No less alarming is the unbridled response of the Higher Education Transformation Network to the decision of the Helen Suzman Foundation to seek clarity from the courts about the interpretation of the constitutional mandate of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). It came out with a statement & condemning and deploring& the application. The fact that the courts have already ruled that the conduct of the JSC is irrational seems to have escaped the attention of the network. Perhaps it has also not noticed that one of the JSC\\'s members has resigned in protest against his inability to persuade his colleagues of the wrong-headedness of their approach to the task of recommending judicial officers for appointment. Further, that the constitutional requirement that race and gender be taken into consideration during this delicate process has been elevated to the & be all and end all& criterion, also seems to have been misconstrued by the network. With all the zeal of the true believer, it has launched into an application to be admitted as a friend of the court somewhat prematurely, even before the JSC has decided whether it wishes to oppose an application that, on the face of it and in the circumstances sketched above, is both necessary and in the public interest. Very properly, the Helen Suzman Foundation has declined to consent to this intervention until such time as the network is able to show whether it has anything to add to assist the court in its deliberations. This it will not be able to do until it knows what the attitude of the JSC toward the application is, as it emerges from the opposing papers that are likely to be filed in court. One is left with the impression that the deploring and condemning is at best grandstanding, at worst a misguided attempt to bully the Helen Suzman Foundation. Its representative has expressed the hope that all interested parties will remain respectful of other parties so that & the status of civility in our democracy is strengthened& More disturbing than the goings on in Parliament and in the Helen Suzman Foundation litigation is the unseemly ridiculing of the Equal Education nongovernmental organisation by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga in a press release responding to its latest initiatives aimed at securing the promulgation of minimum norms and standards for infrastructure in schools. Equal Education has been trying patiently to engage with the minister for three years. In that time, it has had only two meetings with her, one of a rather preliminary nature and the other to settle the litigation on which it had to embark in order to stir the minister into setting the standards for infrastructure that are vital to hold to account those responsible for their provision. While it is widely appreciated and well understood that Motshekga is being dilatory in order to avoid giving civil society a rod with which to beat her back once she does set norms and standards for infrastructure, the fact remains that she settled the court case on the basis that they would all be in place by May 15. Now she wants another six months to do what she agreed to do last November. Her excuses for the delay do not stand up to objective scrutiny and, correctly so, the Eastern Cape High Court, in Grahamstown, has set a date for the urgent hearing of the renewed litigation over norms and standards that Equal Education thought it had settled last November. So Motshekga, unabashedly and shamelessly, has resorted to playing the race and patronisation cards against Equal Education. At first, Equal Education could not believe Motshekga had anything to do with the press release in which the following surprising words appear: & However, to suddenly see a group of white adults organising black African children with half-truths can only be opportunistic, patronising and simply dishonest, to say the least.& Equal Education gave Motshekga the opportunity to dissociate herself from the lack of civility (and accuracy) in the words quoted. She did no such thing. By way of following up, Equal Education has published a comprehensive rebuttal of the inaccuracies in the departmental press statement. A perusal of the affidavit filed in support of the pending court application in Grahamstown shows that Motshekga is going to have her work cut out for her if she is going to succeed in getting more time to do what she agreed to complete by May 15. Twenty broken promises made by or on behalf of Motshekga suggest that she, not Equal Education, is the problem. Seasoned observers of political interaction in SA agree that the playing of the race card is usually the last resort of scoundrels who have run out of better arguments. The & patronisation card& is played less frequently, but usually for the same reason - no other card is left to play. For a grass-roots organisation such as Equal Education to be on the receiving end of accusations of being patronising toward its own constituency must be particularly hurtful to those who have toiled long and hard in its ranks to achieve delivery of the right to basic education, which has been due to all, child and adult alike, since the dawn of democracy. Sisulu has given the uncivil MPs short shrift. The courts will maintain decorum in the Helen Suzman Foundation litigation. Will President Jacob Zuma have anything to say about the effect on nation-building and reconciliation of the words in Motshekga\\'s press release about Equal Education? We are in an election year. Temperatures at the political coal face are rising. Don\\'t expect decisive leadership on this one - the minister happens to be president of the African National Congress Women\\'s League; she is accordingly royal game and need not fear that her feathers will be ruffled by the leader of the Cabinet in which she serves, or is supposed to serve. The racism, dishonesty, inaccuracy and opportunism in the ministerial press release about Equal Education will all go unaddressed, and impunity will prevail. Unity in diversity will have to wait until after the elections. More\\'s the pity. & 8226;Hoffman is a director of the Institute for Accountability in Southern Africa. \\'Twenty broken promises made by Motshekga or on her behalf suggest she, not Equal Education, is the problem\\'\n",

      "\\'Stomach politics\\' prevails in Bekkersdal Trouble in West Rand hotspot runs deep, write A SPRAWLING & mansion& painted deep red and grey, adorned with steel pillars, a high wall and metal gates, stands in stark contrast to the squalor surrounding it - sewage, rubbish and tin shacks surround the home dubbed & Nkandla& by locals in Bekkersdal. The protest-ridden community turned up in their numbers at the polls yesterday, using their democratic right to change their lot in the impoverished West Rand town. Since September, Bekkersdal has seen & service delivery protests& but the problems plaguing this community run deep. & Politics of the stomach& nepotism and allegations of corruption against senior African National Congress (ANC) leaders are at the root of the protests. The situation is a stark reminder of the problems that are common in local government, the coal face of service delivery, across SA. The ANC won 66% of the vote in Westonaria in local government polls in 2011, followed by the Azanian People\\'s Organisation (Azapo) at 13%. The municipality received a qualified audit in 2011-12, and the auditor-general found intervention was required and expressed concern about its leadership. The & mansion& which a resident points out to the Business Day - asking that journalists walk some distance behind her for fear of reprisals - belongs to a leader of the ANC Youth League, Reggie Nkabinde, whose newfound wealth was amassed in mere months, say community members, describing him as a & tenderpreneur& A leader of the Socialist Party of Azania (Sopa), who wishes to remain anonymous, says Mr Nkabinde\\'s & Nkandla& is a slap in the face to the impoverished community in which it is located. The Sopa leader is aligned to the Greater Westonaria Concerned Residents\\' Association, who came together in a bid to have the local municipality dissolved due to maladministration. The association is a conglomerate of parties that put narrow loyalties aside in a bid to improve the plight of the community. It includes members of Azapo, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the Democratic Alliance and even some ANC members. At the end of September, after receiving a mandate from residents in public meetings, the association approached West Rand district mayor Mpho Nawa with demands, including that the Westonaria local municipality be dissolved and mayor Nonkoliso Tundzi fired; that services such as refuse removal and sewerage be improved; and housing be provided. But Mr Nawa told residents there was nothing he could do. A few days later he returned to the area with ANC volunteers to campaign for the party. It was the last straw for residents, who attacked the group with stones and rocks, and chased them out of the area. The tripartite alliance - the South African Communist Party, the ANC and the Congress of South African Trade Unions - stepped in and brokered an agreement with the residents, promising to investigate their demands. Sopa said a dossier containing allegations of corruption against local leaders was handed to the auditor-general for investigation. An ANC member of the residents\\' association, Sipho Mabasa, confirmed this. The dossier also included allegations of nepotism against Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane, during her tenure as housing MEC under the presidency of Thabo Mbeki, who launched a R1bn urban renewal programme in the area. An elderly resident who wished to remain anonymous said yesterday that he had attended many meetings held by the association. & They want to unearth the money issues ... there are many things these people are trying to unearth. My God, there is all the secrecy around the urban renewal. & Forget politics,& he says, & everyone knows politics ... it\\'s stomach politics now.& The community member says there are also Mozambicans living in the area who were party to a & jobs for sale& scheme. Many locals say & outsiders& mainly people from the Eastern Cape, find it easier to access jobs than residents who had lived in the area for generations. Sopa and Mr Mabasa say that while the investigations of corruption in the municipality and in the abandoned urban renewal project began in February, the community has not yet received any feedback. ANC branch electoral co-ordinator Lillian Mosothoane says voting went smoothly yesterday but the ANC, unlike other parties, had a hard time campaigning in the area. The & anti-ANC sentiment& deepened when Ms Mokonyane told residents who booed party officials last year that the ANC did not want their & dirty votes& Ms Mokonyane has apologised on a public platform but residents want her to apologise to them directly. Members of the ANC from the provincial government tried to visit the area but were also chased away. Municipal workers have not been able to clean due to the hostile environment. The situation deteriorated to such a degree that the municipality brought the Red Ants in to clean in February, a move that coincided with the final voter registration drive. It turned violent due to the presence of the red-clad & guards& who are more usually tasked with evictions. Ms Mosothoane says there was also an element of & tribalism& to the unrest, with complaints that municipal workers and even the mayor were not from the area. She hopes that after the election the situation will & calm down& She accuses ANC members of the residents association of being bitter because they failed to secure positions in the 2011 polls. Mr Mabasa says the municipal corruption is & denting the image& of the party. & We don\\'t want to encourage criminals inside the ANC ... the ANC delayed and failed the community but when it comes to elections they are here,& he says, wearing a party beret and T-shirt. & I can\\'t be a member of the ANC unless I am a member of the community first.& Despite his deep concerns, he voted for the ANC and encouraged others to do so too. Sopa has thrown its lot in with the EFF, expected to displace Azapo. Mr Mabaso says the battle will continue after the election. & It is not over ... we will make sure our demands are met or we will take to the streets.& marriann@bdfm.co.za A dossier of allegations of corruption against local leaders was handed to the auditor-general A resident says Mr Nkabinde\\'s \\'Nkandla\\' is a slap in the face to the impoverished community\n",

      "Samwu probe \\'found no misappropriated funds\\' Political Correspondent AN INTERNAL investigation found no evidence that millions of rand had been misappropriated from South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) funds, union leaders said yesterday. Samwu, whose members are at the coal face of service delivery, is known for its vocal opposition to local government corruption. However, its office bearers have faced allegations in recent weeks, including over their lifestyles, while accusations that millions of rand has gone missing from union coffers date back to its 2012 congress. Amid these allegations, Samwu is to press ahead with reining in rebellious provincial leaders, as divisions threaten to split the union. Dozens of Samwu provincial leaders and shop stewards have been suspended or expelled in recent months, in a move some have said is a purge of those asking questions about union finances. Samwu\\'s national leaders in turn yesterday ascribed the allegation of a purge to disgruntled former members trying to destabilise the union. At a media briefing yesterday, Samwu\\'s national officer bearers announced the outcomes of a union probe of numerous allegations levelled at the executive. They said that although a task team had uncovered some inconsistency in financial practices, all accusations of maladministration, malpractice or corruption at the union were baseless. Samwu Limpopo secretary Simon Mathe, who was part of the task team, said yesterday the probe had been narrowed to investigate six allegations, & in the midst of bombardments whose sole purpose was to discredit and assassinate the task team members\\' character& An accusation that R80m was unaccounted for in 2012 was found to be baseless, while access to documentation by the accusers had raised questions over their financial literacy, he said. The union\\'s deputy general secretary, Moses Miya, said the task team\\'s report would now be taken to local structures. Mr Miya urged members to defend the union, which he said was & being bombarded with negativity and a campaign led by disgruntled people whose sole purpose is to sow divisions within the union& Provincial office bearers in the Western Cape, Mpumalanga and the North West had been or would be suspended by the end of this week, he said. The suspensions follow those provinces\\' continued support for other suspended or expelled officials and shop stewards. Contacted for comment, expelled former North West chairman Sello Selepe, spokesman for the Save our Samwu grouping, said yesterday that disgruntled Samwu members would continue a national campaign seeking a forensic audit of the union\\'s finances. He denied that there was an attempt to destroy Samwu. & We are trying to save it,& he said. Congress of South African Trade Unions president Sdumo Dlamini said yesterday that the federation had received written complaints from suspended Samwu members, and had formulated an intervention after meeting with the union\\'s national office bearers. gernetzkyk@bdfm.co.za\n",

      "A welcome investigation THE most surprising aspect of the Competition Commission\\'s announcement that it is investigating allegations of price-fixing, market division and collusive tendering among automotive component suppliers is that the apparent victims - motor manufacturers - seem to have been taken by surprise. It is no secret that SA was among the most concentrated economies in the world when it emerged from the apartheid era, and there have been enough revelations of widespread anticompetitive behaviour over the past two decades for the odds to be relatively high of the automotive sector being among those afflicted with the disease. Many of the practices that are defined as anticompetitive in terms of the Competition Act are so embedded in SA\\'s corporate culture that it has taken considerable effort to convince companies - especially the middle managers who are at the proverbial coal face - that the way they have always done business is morally wrong and now illegal. But that is no excuse. It is incumbent on CEOs and company boards to ensure their subordinates are both informed and compliant with the law. International research indicates that collusive behaviour inflates prices in an economy by 10%-25% and raises barriers to entry for new and small businesses. In the South African context, with the National Development Plan and government policy aimed at encouraging the development of small, medium and micro enterprises as a means of growing the economy and creating jobs, collusion is especially unwelcome. And when you factor in the government\\'s attempts to foster black economic empowerment, business practices that favour the incumbents at the expense of newcomers can expect short thrift. This was apparent with respect to the Department of Economic Development\\'s response to collusion by construction companies in their bids for the multibillion-rand Soccer World Cup stadium contracts, when attempts to justify anticompetitive behaviour on the basis that the work had to be shared out to ensure there was sufficient capacity and to meet tight deadlines did not get much sympathy. Similarly, the investigation that is under way into a cartel of about 70 furniture removal companies that allegedly agreed among themselves who would submit the lowest tenders to win contracts, is unlikely to be put off by claims that it is often government officials that request phony bids and encourage collusion so they can work with a favoured supplier. In the automotive industry, though details are still sketchy, it appears that the local investigation is a spin-off from similar probes that have taken place in the US, Europe and Asia, and that almost all of the 82 component manufacturers in question are based offshore. What is known is that the investigation was initiated when one of the companies that was part of a cartel applied for leniency from prosecution in exchange for information implicating others. US, European and some Asian competition authorities co-operated in their investigations, and the Competition Commission is expected to seek similar assistance as it tries to establish the extent of the harm caused in SA by the alleged price-fixing, market division and collusion. It is likely that emphasis will be placed on establishing whether collusion stifled the development of the domestic parts industry, which has struggled to compete with imports and remains relatively underdeveloped. With the exception of catalytic converters, it is rare for more than one domestic component manufacturer to produce the same part, largely because of the volumes required to achieve economies of scale. Proving that collusion by offshore companies has harmed local competitors will therefore not be easy without input from foreign authorities and admissions by suppliers seeking leniency.\n",

      "Economic dysfunction is undermining Nigeria\\'s progress ONE of the biggest complaints about Nigeria from foreign companies is how unnecessarily difficult it is to do business there. The government is not short of grand plans to diversify its economy and politically expedient quick wins but it is less exercised with dealing with the underlying factors that undermine economic development and diversification. Many of its policies have focused on stimulating local manufacturing to reduce the country\\'s huge import bills. Over the years it has imposed import bans, slapped high tariffs on a range of goods and tried to pick winners to boost industrial development. But it has failed to simultaneously address the dysfunction that makes it so challenging to operate businesses in Nigeria. These include a range of illegal business practices that have developed over the years to the extent they have now become part of the fabric of the economy, despite their corrosive and costly effect on development. An example is smuggling, an issue that may derail the government\\'s latest attempt at industrialisation - building a domestic car manufacturing industry. It has offered international manufacturers a range of incentives to invest. They include revised tariffs on imported used cars, which comprise the majority of vehicles in Nigeria, a country that has tried, and failed, to build a sustainable car industry. Next month, the tariff on used cars, raised to 35% in mid-2014, will be hiked to 70%. Making used cars expensive, aims to encourage people to buy locally assembled and manufactured cars. This is the intention. But the fact is that the smuggling of cars from neighbouring Benin is getting worse. More than 10,000 vehicles a week cross the border into Nigeria from Benin, some legally imported this way to avoid the congested and inefficient port in Lagos, but many smuggled in. The Nigerian ports authority says vehicle imports through Lagos port in January last year, just months after the new car policy was announced, was 27,000 units. In January this year, this had dropped to 8,000 units. This is what the government intended. But in the first month of this year, there was also a 50% rise in vehicle imports into Benin - a red light for manufacturers in Nigeria. The issue was discussed at a conference in Johannesburg last week, where an executive of Nissan, which is producing cars in Nigeria, outlined some of the challenges the company faces there. One of them is smuggled imports, which may threaten the success of their investment. Another is the port in Lagos, through which it imports its semi-knocked-down kits for assembly. It can take months to get the kits out of the port. Political will at the top has not filtered down to the coal face where customs officials, government agencies and other actors hold sway. It is not just cars that are smuggled into Nigeria. South African retailers in Nigeria cannot sell many types of imported shoes because they are on a list of banned imports - but they are freely available on the streets. Illegal imports of rice amount to 8,000 bags a year, undermining efforts to build local rice production. There are many other examples. It is not just business and investors that are affected. The government itself is losing billions in import revenues. Nigeria\\'s economic dysfunction is fuelled both by powerful vested interests which benefit from the status quo and by millions of people who earn incomes from & parallel& economic activities. All of these make it difficult and expensive to do business in the country. The government seems to rely on special deals, import tariff exceptions and incentives to attract investors, rather than making the environment more investor friendly for everyone. Tackling the entrenched economic dysfunction - difficult, but not impossible with the right political will - is essential for the country to transform. & 8226;Games is CEO of African business advisory Africa @ Work.\n",

      "Squabbling unions leave workers vulnerable PENDING retrenchments in the private sector have left thousands of workers at risk, with organised labour at its weakest since 1994. The business of unionism and the Department of Labour, which is meant to regulate the sector, find themselves in a state of paralysis through infighting at a time when workers need representation and labour stability is key to growing a weak economy. In 2012, the headquarters of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) was thrust into a panic when most of its affiliates were threatened with deregistration for failing to comply with the Labour Relations Act. The matter was resolved when unions submitted outstanding information. Three years later, Cosatu affiliates are faced with another bubbling crisis: factional battles that threaten to derail them from implementing their core mandate - to protect workers\\' interests. The Chemical, Paper, Print, Wood and Allied Workers Union (Ceppwawu), which represents about 66,000 workers, is on the brink of being placed under administration in the midst of a dirty factional fight that has spilt over into the Department of Labour. Labour registrar Johan Crouse was removed from his post for trying to place Ceppwawu under administration without consulting Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant. Although Ceppwawu is a Cosatu affiliate, it was the country\\'s two other labour federations - the Federation of Unions of SA and the National Council of Trade Unions - that expressed their concern to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa about the treatment meted out to the registrar. In the gold and coal sectors, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has been locked in tense wage talks, but its general secretary, David Sipunzi, has come under fire from within its ranks after he voted against the adoption of credentials at Cosatu\\'s special national congress last month. Insiders are contemplating disciplinary action against him as he is said to have gone against a mandated union position. Not to be outdone, the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) has become entangled in the Passenger Rail Agency of SA\\'s (Prasa\\'s) boardroom brawl and come out as a staunch backer of CEO Lucky Montana. Mr Montana was given his marching orders last month following a public falling out with chairman Popo Molefe. Corruption allegations doing the rounds between Prasa and Satawu\\'s leadership saw the union split in 2012 and spawned the formation of its rival, the National Transport Movement. In the time since, the new union has dethroned Satawu as the majority union at South African Airways. The need for strong unions in the face of looming job cuts has been underlined by the recent ruling in the Labour Court in Johannesburg halting retrenchments at Telkom because of the company\\'s failure to follow due process. The state of affairs that led to Mineral Resources Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi\\'s withdrawal of Glencore Optimum\\'s mining licence is a further example of the perils of failing to follow due process during retrenchments, although he has conditionally lifted the suspension. The minister spent most of last week in crisis talks with mine bosses about retrenchments. The NUM expects up to 11,000 jobs could be lost in mining and has threatened to go on strike should this happen. While the current economic climate demands that unions remain on top of their game, palace politics continue to dominate in the upper echelons at the expense of the thousands of men and women at the coalface. marriann@bdfm.co.za (This is) at a time when workers need representation and labour stability is key to growing a weak economy AT RISK: Satawu members march to the Union Buildings last month demanding that fired Prasa CEO Lucky Montana be reinstated.

      "We have been here before. The third major public service strike since 1994 is upon us. During the first major public service strike since democracy, in 1999, trade unions suffered a significant defeat with government\\'s unilateral implementation of wages. But in 2007, public service unions turned the tables on government, conducting an unprecedented strike and building an unlikely coalition with departments responsible for frontline service delivery. This resulted in the introduction of occupational specific dispensations (OSDs) that put new occupational classifications, promotions and grading systems in place. In both 1999 and 2007, there was the promise that the crises occasioned by national strikes would create the opportunity for long-run reforms in the public service. Sadly, in both instances this has not been the case. Will it, however, be \"third time lucky\" after this strike - with a better deal both for transforming service delivery as well as increasing employment in the public service? The concept of using collective bargaining for wider ends is commonplace in labour relations. In South Africa, the historic strikes in the mining sector and the introduction of skills development in the metal sector\\'s bargaining are widely regarded as examples of meeting wider ends. The public service would thus be a very apt candidate for conducting what is called \"transformative bargaining\". The concept, which has survived various iterations over the years, implies a two-fold commitment to bargaining from parties. First, that negotiating parties share a common commitment to transform public services through social dialogue. With the majority of public service unions in alliance with the ANC, and a stronger relationship between Cosatu and the Independent Labour Caucus at a political level, there have been strong prospects for developing a shared vision. Even the ideological stances and policy approaches of parties are not a major barrier to effective social dialogue, despite heated disagreements on privatisation. Second, that policy choices require leadership. Increasing employment in the public service is an important example of implementing a difficult policy choice. In the current dispute, government has argued that it has no additional funds to increase both salaries and employment at the same time. Militancy The position of government thus presents a stark set of choices, which is exactly what spurs militancy in the public service. Yet, there are well-developed proposals in the public domain that provide a range of options to introduce reforms that support long-run and service delivery oriented \"employment creation\" in the public service, while also providing salary increases. For example, government could introduce a lower level of jobs to ease the burden on professionals in the public sector, while at same time creating employment for a new generation of currently unemployed people. This could include increasing the number of teaching assistants and clerical support in schools to free up teachers to concentrate on teaching, while support staff deal with administration and other functions. This new category of workers, while earning entry-level salaries, could use this opportunity to gain much-needed work experience as well improve their qualifications. The proposals would ask of trade unions to factor in \"employment creation\" in developing their negotiations strategy. Importantly, the proposals are not small, with some going as far as proposing the creation of a quarter of a million new jobs within five years, and with costs requiring only moderate changes to baseline estimates. These proposals ultimately ask our society to meet both the objectives of providing workers a living wage while at the same time increasing employment, especially for young workers. Yet, government has not tabled any of these proposals during this salary round. Had it done so, the effect on bargaining would be nothing short of groundbreaking, shifting from haggling over percentages to debating and costing a developmental role for the government and public service unions. This approach promises a great deal: a labour-absorbing public service, better salaries, improved performance, less corruption and a professional public service. Why then have we not moved in this direction? In the parlance of negotiators in the public service, it has to do with \"cowboy bargaining\". By this it is meant that both parties adopt extremely strident and unrealistic initial positions, which not only sets in motion an adversarial stance, but more importantly lacks a wider policy framework. For government, this reflects the absence of leadership in developing policies to refocus bargaining on a developmental agenda. Doing this would require that government carefully unpacks a long-term reform programme in the public service, outside of the collective bargaining process. In some senses, it may replicate the processes developed after the democratic breakthrough that integrated the apartheid public service, and sought to bring about the reorientation of the public service to a development mandate. The entire policy package that served us in making the transition towards an integrated and democratic public service is now in need of urgent review to ensure that public services play a developmental role by widening opportunities and equalising outcomes, especially for the poor. Sadly, government has much to do to reach this ideal. The lack of a coherent message from government was demonstrated with the introduction of the OSD. The OSD provides for much-needed reviews of salary scales, provides career paths that keep excellent public servants at the coal face, and introduces internships as part of a major shake-up of public service employment. The process of the OSD was driven by service delivery departments, especially the health and education departments. The process led to a much-needed review of teachers\\' and nurses\\' salaries as well as other smaller sectors. These agreements were reached at the sector level bargaining chambers that focus on health, education and safety and security. The review and subsequent agreements had financial implications, while government signed salary agreements that also had fiscal costs. However, the combination of decisions at a sector level on OSD and those at the central bargaining level on salaries, were not co-ordinated. This led to the current budget position, with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan pointing out the hard reality of future affordability of high salary increases. Yet, at a deeper level, it also indicates significant policy incoherence in government, between demands at a sector level with those at the central level. This is not to suggest incompetence by government negotiators, but rather that policy contradictions were not ironed out nor were careful policy choices made at the cabinet level. During this bargaining round, government\\'s strategy has been confusing and misleading. The government was reluctant to admit early on that there was a dispute, keeping unions\\' hopes alive by continuously asking for more time. Yet, when strike action was initiated, it moved quickly to finalise its offer. The trade unions themselves need to be more introspective. While the salary demands from unions are not excessive, they need to be viewed against salary adjustments due to the OSD. Having a three-year retrospective perspective on salaries could have provided the basis for arriving at a settlement. Surprisingly, this pragmatic concession has a precedent after the 2007 strike. Despite the strong mobilisation, unions pushed for an increase slightly above inflation to accommodate future adjustments in the OSD. But with the government moving quickly towards unilateral implementation in the current strike, the prospects for a pragmatic resolution have receded. However, even under these conditions, trade unions need to exercise their power to advance a broader reform process in the public service. Ironically, both parties have tried to refocus bargaining through participating in the Public Service Summit. They have also engaged in a series of social dialogue processes guided by ideals of \"mutual gains bargaining\". These important initial steps should not be discounted for future public policy. However, neither government nor the unions can point towards tangible results from these processes. In the cut-and-thrust of salary negotiations, the tangible nature of agreements matters. The worrying factor is that earlier progress in the areas of performance and resourcing the public service might be undone during this acrimonious salary round. The reality is that without reaching these wider agreements quickly, we can anticipate the fourth major public service strike sooner rather than later. Descending into an adversarial bargaining stance over a longer period of time would set back the reform process in the public service at precisely the moment when significant improvements are needed. Reaching this wider agreement requires a commitment to building the public service to meet the developmental challenges that we face. For these reasons, a speedy resolution to the public service strike must be found, while strengthening social dialogue processes. Sadly, for now it seems that the cowboys are in charge, and, yes, we have been here before. l Hassen is an independent researcher and public policy analyst.

Matt Faddes The Highlander\\'s underrated star in their Super Rugby season last year, Faddes was playing club rugby in Otago in 2015 before suddenly finding himself scoring 10 tries in the world\\'s toughest competition. Full of pace, with incredible vision and an eye for the line, Faddes will surprise many who give this unassuming winger even a sniff of a gap. Robert du Preez The Stormers flyhalf showed he could step up when the men from Cape Town suffered a bit of a flyhalf crisis at the beginning of the season, but for injury, he could well have seen himself in green and gold this tour. Able to play it tight, and kick his points, Du Preez also showed in the Varsity Cup that he has an eye for the line and the size to mix it up right at the coal face. His running of the game could be key for a dangerous Barbarian backline. Michael Fatialofa The athletic 24-year-old lock has been a revelation for the Hurricanes slotting into their free flowing style of play as if he was an outside back. Abrasive yet silky, tough as nails but a clever ball player, Fatialofa will no doubt thrive in a Barbarians team where he is allowed to throw the ball around and look for the miracle passes - which often stick from the big man. Akker van â€¨der Merwe The angry warthog, as he has been dubbed, Van der Merwe played a a small role for the Lions behind now Springbok Malcolm Marx, but when ever he did get a chance he set the stage on fire with his runs. Low to the ground and powerful through the tackle, he thrives in bounding his way through defences and will cause a number of problems in the tight loose for the Boks\n",

      "THE Springboks reacted to their humiliation at the hands of the All Blacks by bringing back overseas-based flanker Francois Louw and gambling on utility back Dillyn Leyds for tomorrow\\'s Rugby Championship game against Australia in Bloemfontein. Coach Allister Coetzee, promising a strong response in Bloemfontein to the Springboks\\' record 57-0 loss to the All Blacks two weeks ago, was also able to recall regular scrumhalf Ross Cronje after illness. Coetzee hopes it will be enough to repair the Boks\\' shattered confidence after their heaviest defeat ever and stave off renewed calls for him to leave the job. Australia are poised to make the most of the Springbok\\'s woes, although the Wallabies haven\\'t won in South Africa since 2011 and have also switched things around . Lock Izack Rodda, flanker Jack Dempsey, and winger Marika Koroibete will start for Australia for the first time, part of coach Michael Cheika\\'s plan to \"change it up\" as he seeks his first win in South Africa. The 21-year-old Rodda, especially, will find himself at the coal face against the desperate Springboks. \"Izack is young, he is eager, and I want to give them these experiences so they can learn,\" Cheika said. \"I don\\'t think there is any risk there because he has come off the bench and played well in two big games and I can\\'t see why starting is any different. It\\'s a step along the way.\" History is against Australia, who have struggled in South Africa for the last six years. The Wallabies may be boosted by the fact that they ran New Zealand close last month, something South Africa hasn\\'t been able to do for years. For South Africa, Louw comes in at flank for Jean-Luc du Preez and Leyds at right wing for Raymond Rhule, who was severely criticised for his defensive performance against the rampant All Blacks in Albany. Chiliboy Ralepelle, has been brought in on the bench and could play his first Test since 2013. Rhule and scrumhalf Francois Hougaard, who started two weeks ago, have paid the biggest prices for the 57-0 drubbing by being left out of the 23 completely. Rhule was sent back to his domestic team as Coetzee was forced to act after the worst of a string of embarrassing results in his 18-month reign. \"We know we had a substandard game, but we have put it behind us and are busy with our turnaround strategy,\" he said. \"The players and management have had a meeting, and we all want to make things right this week.\" The team had now \"buried Albany,\" Coetzee said. \"That defeat won\\'t define us. We\\'re not going to sweep it under the carpet, but so far we have won five out of seven this season, and at times we\\'ve played outstanding rugby. What is key now is our response.\"\n",

      "Paraphrasing Noam Chomsky, \"The ANC KwaZulu-Natal is stumbling the province around in a fog of mystification.\" Indeed, KZN is \"headed to hell in a handbasket\", as TS Elliot might say. The citizens of KZN by and large are clinging to a threadbare cloth. A frightful fall is imminent, the consequences of which we will endure for generations. Regrettably, our so-called African leaders collectively feign blindness and deafness. They have forsaken their leadership obligations. And in so doing, they have increased the burden that pins down the natural progression of our community. O Jeffrey, in his book After The Darkest Night Comes the Day: Change, quotes a heart-piercing speech by Martin Luther King jr on March31, 1968, when addressing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference at the Episcopal National Cathedral, Washington, DC. He said: \"On some positions, Cowardice asks the question, \\'Is it safe?\\' Expediency asks the question, \\'Is it politic?\\' And Vanity comes along and asks the question, \\'Is it popular?\\' \"But Conscience asks the question, \\'Is it right?\\' And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor political, nor popular, but he must do it because Conscience tells him it is right.\" In the past, we rallied around political goals conceptualised from an ethos of Ubuntu, the African conception of humanism that proclaimed \"an injury to one is an injury to all\". Does it still apply today? We Africans must ask ourselves some hard questions, in particular about what is right and what has gone terribly wrong in our province. \"We are sick and tired of working without being paid. Transnet is getting millions from eThekwini municipality... but every month we are not getting paid on time,\" said Nhlanhla Bhengu. On February1, 2016, Bhengu and his fellow drivers were referred to as \"nonsensical\" when they blocked the flow of traffic in the Durban city centre. There was no public outcry regarding their grievances. These breadwinners were stripped of their dignity and manhood, and disempowered as the protectors and providers of their families. Contemplate in totality the repercussions of a man who says: \"I am in debt now because I have to borrow money to buy groceries.\" While these breadwinners, embarking on strikes, were confronted with failing to provide basic needs to their dependants, community leaders and politicians stuck their heads in the sand. Church leaders, meanwhile, failed to stand up and defend the exploited. The recent crop of social justice and empowerment organisations, and black professional organisations that claim to speak for the exploited, were conspicuously silent. Meanwhile, the injustice was not meted out by Indian, white, or coloured business people, but by a company owned by an African family. There was no \"injury to one is any injury to all\". Where is our Ubuntu now? eThekwini councillors are being pompous and arrogant. They pretend to know little about poverty. It is sad that almost all of them have forgotten that they come from the most humble family backgrounds. Remember the aborted sinful boat cruise where 40 councillors were expected to board the MSC Sinfonia for a cruise to the Portuguese Islands between March4 and 7 in 2016? The cruise was to be at the expense of ratepayers. It is one of many excruciating kicks in the teeth of the destitute. The same councillors have been accused, by their own bodyguards, of ignoring their challenges: \"We have been raising our salary predicament since 2005. We have raised it with management; the city manager is aware of it.\" Are the souls of our African academics, intellectuals and community leaders in covenant with cowardliness, expediency, and vanity? The hope and soul of the community is wretchedly laid bare for the prophets of mirage to feast on. Our historical quest to attain social justice for all has been forsaken on the floor to be stamped by scoundrels who masquerade as the voice of the downtrodden. Who has the courage and the will to pick up the ethos of social justice among the current crop of African community leaders? Who monitors the most excruciating injustices meted out against citizens in KwaZulu-Natal? The Xubera Institute for Research and Development (Xubera) believes that among the citizens of KwaZulu-Natal we have plenty of people who possess a spirit of bravery, honesty and integrity. Africans cannot forever survive on the benevolence of other community leaders. The silence of our community leaders was exposed by Professor McQuoid-Mason, president of the Commonwealth Legal Education Association, who took it upon himself to approach the public protector about the living conditions and ongoing killings in Glebelands Hostel, Umlazi, south of Durban. He did not seek political leadership directives or a government meeting for approval to tackle the dilemma. Dr Rama Naidu of the Democracy Development Programme and Vasu Gounden of the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes have been at the coal face of untangling these social knots for decades. Their research institutes are non-partisan and financially self-sustaining. They operate outside the confines of traditional academic institutions. Professors Salim Abdool Karim and Quarraisha Abdool Karim have deservedly been honoured internationally for their sterling work in health science research. Their Centre for the Aids Programme of Research in South Africa has become an internationally recognised institution. Dr Imtiaz Sooliman of Gift of the Givers is undisputed so far. Advocate Kessie Naidoo, Professor Hoosen (Jerry) Coovadia, Ela Gandhi, Judge Zakaria Mohammed Yacoob and Professor Ashwin Desai are independent, determined, and honest knights in shining armour on behalf of their communities. All these community leaders have scars that bear testimony to their commitment to a good cause. They do not mind going public and standing against a popular tide to speak the truth. Surely every Indian child wishes to emulate the character of these individuals? Material poverty imbued with hopelessness is spiritually disempowering, leading to a multiplicity of vulnerability. Toxic tentacles of political parties have encroached and enfolded the spiritual space. Political leaders have ascended to an incarnation of hope. The church principals have relegated themselves to being midgets compared with political leaders. They are on their feeble knees with bowed spines, begging for mercy from political leaders. In the recent xenophobia outbreak, the public took note of an assortment of church leaders, in their medieval regalia, being shepherded to the valley of nothingness by municipal officials and politicians. In the twinkling of an eye, without reporting a substantial solution emanating from their soliloquies with municipality officials, they disappeared to their respective bottomless holes. Traditionally, church leaders are perceived as crusaders of truth and protectors of the vulnerable. Strangely, we have not heard them protesting against social ills, rampant government and corporate corruption, and the prevailing apartheid system that excludes and still thrives on dehumanising African people. In this valley of silence, especially from church leaders, one recalls Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor and an anti-Nazi dissident who once said, \"Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.\" Karl Marx departed somewhat early, not having had the chance to witness the mutation of political parties to become the \"opium of the people\". In African countries, after the de-legislation of colonial laws, the anointed liberation political party evolved into a super-social structure. It re-engineered the values, beliefs and norms of the country. Christopher Hadnagy eloquently summarises it as \\'\"social engineering is an art. It further disempowers the oppressed. Subsequently the national symbol of citizenship and identity is replaced by that of the anointed political liberation party. Scholars of sociology will argue that it is precarious when impermanent social structures such as political parties redefine the identity, morals and ethics of any community. The National Party and National Socialist German Workers\\' Party are infamous examples. The point of analysis converges to the reality that a lack of fearless truth-tellers within the African community is due to a fear of ostracism. Let the conscience of African academics, church leaders, professionals, the business community, forward thinkers and many more, lead them to do the right thing by warmly embracing the frail hands of the condemned. It is time for community leaders to take a position that is \"neither safe, nor political, nor popular, but they must do what conscience tells them is right\". I still hold the belief that the African soul and integrity have not been devoured by the offers of impotent government appointments such as commissions, boards and other non-consequential committees. Let every African citizen be brave and lead our beloved province to \"throw off the yoke of slavery\". For the sake of the next generation, we must depart from this earth knowing that we stopped Africans from salivating randomly for hand-outs and crumbs from the leaders of other communities. l Dube is a senior researcher at the Xubera Institute for Research and Development\n",

      "Premiers have expressed their wishes on what the National Council of provinces (NCOP) should do for their provinces. Parliament - Premiers have expressed their wishes on what the National Council of provinces (NCOP) should do for their provinces in the sixth term of the second House of Parliament. This emerged when the NCOP held its first sitting for the term on Thursday. Gauteng Premier David Makhura said they put their hopes as provinces on the NCOP. Makhura said one of the first things they would ask NCOP to look at was the size of their legislature. \"We have put this matter before the fifth NCOP and that matter was not concluded,\" he said. Makhura said Gauteng has the largest population and its maximum of MPLs was supposed to be 80. \"On behalf of the people of our province, we want to say it should be among the first priorities of the sixth NCOP,\" he said. North West Premier Job Mokgoro said his rural province has witnessed public protests with communities raising complaints. Mokgoro said the protests have shifted from urban to rural areas over cross-cutting issues contained in memorandum of complaints they attended to over provision of adequate clean water and improved road infrastructure, among others. The province was still under administration and several more municipalities were also placed under administration. \"We are making steady progress to stabilise public services in North West,\"Mokgoro said. \"I want to appeal that there is there is a dire need to place much more emphasis on intervention in our ailing municipalities. This should be done not only in North West but jerk up service delivery in all struggling municipalities across the country as these are the coal face of service delivery,\" he said. Northern Cape Premier Zamani Saul said the issue of review of formula of the equitable share, allocations made by National Treasury to provinces based on population, should be revisited. \"It disadvantages us. It does not take into account numbers and vastness you have. It is expensive to implement decisions by virtue of distances we need to travel,\" Saul said. \"We commit to put this item on the agenda of this legislative sector,\" he said. However, other premiers focused on realising the needs of the people and need to put the interests of their provinces first. Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela said they had moved around all provinces during elections and heard what people wanted. \"We have listened to them as they were telling us about their needs. We heard our people cry for better and faster service delivery. They have cried for jobs for their children. They want houses, water and electricity,\" Ntombela said. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala said they continue to work together as provinces to raise issues that affected their respective provinces. \"We want to remind this House that it derives its existence from the will of the people as they expressed themselves on May 8 in the elections. \"We should accept and work together and represent South Africans genuinely and pursue their interests,\" Zikalala said. Limpopo\\'s delegate Mamagase Nchabeleng said their task was to ensure aspirations and interests of provinces were carried out and ensure issues emanating from provinces were represented by those sent to the NCOP. Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtsweni urged NCOP delegates to be driven by a relentless commitment to improve the quality of life of South Africans. Mtsweni said Mpumalanga delegates should execute their responsibilities without fear. \"If you are partisan, be partisan for the interests of Mpumalanga and South Africa,\" she said.

Crosshead Copy Second par Crosshead Copy conomic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Zungu penned a gushing tribute to the way the ANC president \"disarmed\" an international correspondent, made \"poignant\" remarks in seminar rooms and lunches, and was likened to Brazilian P Figures on liquidations and insolvencies were once a useful indicator of economic conditions. When times got bad and people defaulted on their debt, disgruntled creditors sought a legal remedy to get their money back, liquidating companies and declaring people insolvent. But things have changed. Azar Jammine, the chief economist at Econometrix, says the figures on liquidations and insolvencies have not shown the surge in financial distress that \"might have been expected\" over the last year. The economy contracted for three consecutive quarters, starting at the end of 2008, and banks reported a sharp rise in bad debt. But there was not a similar increase in liquidations and insolvencies, according to Jammine. He attributes this partly to the National Credit Act (NCA), introduced in 2007, which \"may have caused creditors to use other methods to get their money back, possibly reaching agreements with people who are defaulting on their debt. Creditors can\\'t easily put pressure on (defaulters) to pay up.\" The NCA shifted the balance of power between lenders and borrowers. Among other things it introduced the concept of \"reckless lending\" - lending money to people who are in no position to pay it back. And it gave borrowers the right to get their debt repayments rearranged, if they were unable to meet their original commitments. Jammine says another complication is the \"huge bureaucracy\" involved in putting people into liquidation. The process is so time consuming that it is proving a big disincentive to creditors trying to get their money back. This is probably a major reason why bank credit is taking so long to recover. On a year-on-year basis, credit granted to the private sector has been falling since late last year. While it may delay the recovery, the shift in behaviour will save both lenders and borrowers a lot of pain down the line. Finance Followers of economic trends and financial markets had expected that the next big news, after the global economic crisis of the past two years, would be long-term economic recovery. After all, comments from observers were bullish about the economic recovery and the stability of financial markets going forward. But this country\\'s corporate world - at the coal face of anything that could go wrong in our economy - believes that risks are still there and anything can happen. Dave Brink, the chairman of Absa, South Africa\\'s biggest retail bank, says the fiscal stresses of euro zone countries such as Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal have added to the global economic uncertainty. How these stresses are resolved might affect interest rates and investor confidence. Brink says the level of global co-ordination by regulators, governments and the private sector has been impressive. But there are signs that this co-ordination is beginning to fragment. Some countries, most notably the US, have embarked on reforms that are out of step with the proposals agreed last year by the Group of 20 (G20) nations, the Financial Stability Forum and the Bank of International Settlements. Last year, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors agreed on the need for more stringent capital requirements for risky trading activities and off-balance sheet items. They also agreed on greater disclosure of the level and structure of remuneration for those whose actions have a material impact on risk taking. Brink\\'s comments come shortly after Philip Broadley, the group finance director at Old Mutual, said the continued volatility in world economic conditions could hit the global wealth manager\\'s performance. He said volatility in world economic conditions had created uncertainty in equity markets and currency fluctuations. This basically means South Africa should brace itself for another round of job losses. This could really be bad for the economy, which has already shed 1 million jobs. page 19 Broadcasting The staggered unveiling of TopTV, the new, or not-so-new, kid on the pay-TV block, is as gut wrenching as the agony a proportion of viewers must have felt while DStv owner MultiChoice toyed with the prospect of adding an adult entertainment channel to its line-up. TopTV launches next month and one could be forgiven for thinking that DStv\\'s rival somehow ran out of marketing budget. Save for a few stories resultant from random media briefings there has been little hype building up to the launch. It begs the question of whether or not the channel is within a whiff of its goal to attract at least 5.5 million subscribers to its services. Interestingly the company armed advertising firm Net#work BBDO with R120 million last year to make sure its name would ring from every corner. At the time, the firm\\'s managing director, Eric D\\'Oliveria, promised: \"We are going to be using all of the communication channels and media platforms in launching the brand. \"The creative campaign will be deployed in digital, above the line, below the line, through the line, in activation, in outdoor channels - across all media platforms.\" Advertising bombardment of such dizzying proportions has not yet been felt. TopTV\\'s Melinda Connor said this week that a teaser print campaign was launched last weekend in Sunday newspapers. \"Radio and television has been running. Billboards are up and about and also branded taxis and buses will soon be seen around town,\" she said. A campaign featuring footballer Steven Pienaar launches next month. Another media briefing will be held tomorrow with a party later on. On Friday at a breakfast former US vice-president Al Gore will confirm his association with the pay-TV station.

      "VIVA, The Star, viva! In a hard-hitting editorial on Monday, January 24, you laid it on the line regarding the mess in the municipality\\'s billing system and the seemingly endless misery experienced by its ratepayers. Indeed, the only way forward was to bring in outside help, as the DA suggested. The ever-blustering Amos Masondo was finally stung into personal public defence, rather than have his inept minions in his ANC caucus (sorry, mayoral committee) take up the cudgels. \"No crisis! No crisis!\", he protested, saying it was only some glitches with the IT system, operators needed training (what, at this stage?), and there was no need to involve the minister. Well, clearly, Minister Sicelo Shiceka did get involved. On the radio on Friday, a spokesman acknowledged that municipalities were in difficulties and suggested that improvements could be made in communication channels with their ratepayers. Encouraged by this, but still doubtful, I again tried to ring Joburg connect to follow up on my long-standing personal problems with the billing system. My problem is perhaps minor, a mere R6 000-odd overpayment. Last August, I discovered that a bogus electricity meter had appeared on my monthly invoices since May, recording consumption considerably higher than the true (and checked) combined readings from the real two meters. What followed was a month of frustration, dialling and eventually getting through to 011 375 5555. The official agreed with the basis of my complaint and promised to report it. My December 2010 bill was still showing the bogus meter charges. Trying again this morning, I got through fairly promptly to a helpful person who confirmed my complaint, expressed astonishment that my problem had not yet been attended to and that the overpayments had not yet been refunded. I pointed out that I was but one of a multitude of others, and thanked him for his courtesy. I may yet be disappointed, but thought I detected a greater sense of urgency and awareness. The council undoubtedly has many excellent people at the coal face, such as those attending complaints, fixing faults in the streets and maintaining parks, who are often rendered ineffective by poor management.

      "Provinces are set to receive almost R70 billion in conditional grants from the national budget in the 2011/2012 financial year. These grants are ring-fenced to ensure they can be spent only on the specific purpose for which they are intended. They cannot be used to plug a few gaping holes in provincial budgets or buy the premier a shiny new car. And though smaller than the national government\\'s other contribution to provinces, the equitable share (R288.4bn), conditional grants are often directed at the coal face of government spending - to eradicate mud schools, provide for disaster relief, build clinics, improve HIV and Aids awareness and fix provincial roads, for instance. These are functions that the|constitution assigns to the national government, but provincial governments are often better placed to spend the money. The biggest grant by far is the Human Settlements Development Grant (R14.9bn, up from R12.4bn in 2010/2011) that must be used to build houses and service property sites. Last year the nine provinces completed 161 854 housing units and serviced 64 362 sites with this grant. They spent 98.5 percent of the total allocation. However, half way through last year, the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal were performing so poorly|on their housing spend that Human Settlements Minister Tokyo Sexwale confiscated R263m and R200m from them respectively and handed over most of the money to the Northern Cape (R182m) and Limpopo (R131m), where spending was on track. The National Tertiary Services Grant - to compensate provinces for providing health-care services (in provincial hospitals) that normally form part of the national government competency - is the next biggest conditional grant with an allocation of R8bn (up from R6.7bn). Last year provinces recorded more than 3 million in-patient days, 2.2m day patients and about 2.3m outpatient visits and follow-ups. More than R7.4bn (up sharply from R4.3bn) will go towards the Comprehensive HIV and Aids Grant that funds a range of HIV-related interventions at provincial level. The Provincial Roads Maintenance Grant (R6.4bn) is the largest of a package of nine new grants announced by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in his 2011/2012 Budget and will be used for \"preventative, routine and emergency (road) maintenance\", according to Treasury documents. The troubled Hospital Revitalisation Grant (R4.1bn) - which is used to fund large-scale upgrades to provincial hospitals, but was underspent by 27 percent last year - is one of the reasons Gordhan read the riot act to provincial leaders during his Budget speech this week. The National School Nutrition Grant (R4.5bn) aims to improve learning capacity by providing needy pupils with at least one nutritious meal a day.Two more big-ticket items are both new: the Education Infrastructure Grant (R5.4bn) and the Further Education and Training (FET) Grant (4.3bn). About R700 million will go to a new School Infrastructure Backlog Grant to help eradicate mud schools and a whopping R5.4bn will be spent on speeding up the construction of new schools and libraries as well as maintaining or upgrading existing facilities. And provinces will get a new R305m Provincial Disaster Grant to deal with existing and possible future damage cause by natural|disasters.\n",

      "Open letter to Minister of Police Nathi Mthethwa on the death of Meleke Andries Tatane Dear Mr Mthethwa We have viewed the video footage of your officers beating and shooting to death Mr Andries Tatane in Ficksburg on Wednesday, April 13. We have also taken note of the decision of the SAPS not to immediately suspend and arrest the officers and their commanders implicated in his death. Our moral and ethical astonishment at this decision aside, we feel it necessary to point out to you the danger of the direction in which you are leading the police. South Africa is a country that continues to confront dangerously high levels of poverty and inequality. It is the case today that just under 50 percent of black people live in what we define as relative poverty. This is a figure largely unchanged from that in 1994. Today just over 50 percent of young black men in the country are unemployed. Among young black women the figure is over 60 percent. The government\\'s primary policy response to these figures has been service delivery and the transfer of wealth from taxpayers to poor households via social grants. The number of households living in formal houses has doubled over a decade. The number of people receiving social grants has increased from about 3 million to 14 million over an even shorter period. Today a third of black households get their single biggest source of income from state handouts. Only 50 percent of black households report employment as their biggest source of income. What these initiatives have also done is to tie the living standards of a great many South Africans directly to what the state can give them. It follows therefore that if people are not satisfied with their living standards, they will lay the blame at the door of the state. When they perceive that the state does not react speedily enough to their demands for a better standard of living, they protest. When they perceive that the state does not pay due regard to their protests, those protests become violent. Over the past decade the proportion of people who feel that such violent protest is justified has doubled, survey data shows. There has also been an increase in the number of such protests and, more importantly, in the number of protesters. These protests are now the primary form of political expression for many poor communities in South Africa. The potential implications of your police\\'s actions in putting down such protest action should be apparent to you. But in case it is not, we can spell it out. What the South African police are effectively engaged in is no longer a simple matter of law enforcement. Rather your officers are now at the coal face of the political struggle of poor black South Africans to be liberated from poverty. Beating, let alone shooting to death on national TV, a protester who by many accounts came to the defence of others being assaulted by your police, can provoke a political reaction you will not be able to contain. It is surely not necessary to point out to anyone who has been involved in the political struggle in South Africa over the past 50 years that there is precedent for this. You need to take action to suspend and prosecute, for culpable homicide if not murder, all the officers implicated in the death of Mr Tatane. These should include the ranking officers on the scene in Ficksburg who could not exercise proper command over their men. Your police suspended two flying squad officers earlier this year for offending Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. What does it say to the people of South Africa that the police cannot find the courage to suspend and arrest those who killed Mr Tatane, whose only mistake was that he had the courage to confront the state in fighting for his right to dignity and a better life?

      "The killing of citizens by the police during times of protest is reaching crisis proportions. South Africa has hardly recovered from the Marikana tragedy and we now have three citizens mowed down last week by the police during a service delivery protest in Mothutlung. Also, a street trader in Pretoria recently died after he was allegedly shot by the Tshwane metro police. These incidents raise a number of questions. What culture exists within our police service? Is it that of skop, skiet en donner as was the case during the days of apartheid? Have we failed in transforming the policing culture from that of an adversarial and confrontational relationship with the community to that of co-operation? It ought to worry all of us when some of our police see protesting citizens as potential targets for their service pistols. The police brutality we see emerging must be dealt with urgently and decisively. Otherwise there will be a breakdown of trust between the police and the community and that is the last thing we want. South Africa has been there before and we know the consequences. I have no insight into how police are trained, but if the incidents I have cited above are anything to go by, it would seem to me special attention must be given to their training, especially the handling of violent protests. Our protests, especially those related to service delivery, tend to be violent. The police need to be trained and equipped on how to deal with these if we are to avoid further bloodshed and loss of lives. The reality is that we will still have more service delivery protests that could turn violent. As South Africans, we have yet to overcome our past violent streak and how apartheid brutalised us. But that is no excuse for the violence that accompanies service delivery protests. Community leaders who organise such protests have a responsibility to educate their followers about both their right and duty during a protest or march. A protest does not have to be violent or result in the destruction of property in order to register a point. Often the property that gets destroyed is communal and after it has been razed to the ground, it is the same community that remains the poorer. Community or civic leaders who encourage such behaviour do not, in my view, have the best interests of the communities they lead at heart. The message must firmly go out to our communities that the right to protest does not mean the right to vandalise or destroy property, public or private. We need education campaigns around this matter before violent service delivery protests take root and are regarded as the norm in our communities. If we don\\'t do this, we shall all be losers. I am aware that all the above measures are merely dealing with the symptoms. The real malaise is the lack of service delivery. There would be no need for communities to take to the streets if delivery was taking place and/or communities were being regularly given feedback about development targets and progress in their areas. The coal face (municipalities) of service delivery in our country is largely in trouble. Take for example the very same Mothutlung where three residents were killed. Why would interruptions in water supply occur, and without notice to the community as to when they will end, if the municipality\\'s technicians knew what they were doing? For the water pumps to reach the stage where they had to be stripped to assess the extent of their damage, thus causing the interruption in water supply, the question has to be asked as to what happened to infrastructure maintenance. When one adds the allegation that the municipality there has underspent on its municipal infrastructure grant, it becomes clear why the area erupted. We welcome the restoration of the water supply in Mothutlung, but it did not have to take the death of three residents for that to happen. Also, it did not have to take the intervention of the Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa. There is a mayor and municipal manager there. Finally, while we must welcome the ruling party\\'s condemning of the shooting of residents, Luthuli House must not behave like a non-governmental organisation. It governs South Africa and must call those it has deployed in government to account for the unfortunate incidents of Mothutlung and Tshwane. And its brief message to them must be: not in our name.

      "Gauteng Premier David Makhura has promised austerity for top brass in his government, a relook at e-tolls and that no excuses will be accepted from officials who fail to deliver. Makhura laid out some of his government priorities yesterday during the announcement of a new provincial cabinet of 10 MECs. In an attempt to appease the growing discontent over abuse of public money by government officials, Makhura threw down a gauntlet on the officials stating \"every cent counts in making a difference in communities\". He said service delivery would be \"the hallmark of his government\". He said his attitude was that public resources raised from taxes must be looked after and used prudently. \"We have to use this resources to promote development,\" he told the Saturday Star. \"Our people and the taxpayers need to see that paying tax is a worthy cause. We want a prudent approach to the use of public resources, including how as the |executive team and government department we spend the money provided to us.\" He said the Treasury had put \"fairly good measures on the prudent use of public funds and we are going to support that\". He added this approach had influenced his decision to name MEC Barbara Creecy as finance MEC. Makhura also revealed that his government would be looking at \"everything without exception\" - including e-tolling - that concerned the people of Gauteng. He said together with other spheres of government \"we want to find the most sustainable way of addressing all the problems that exist in Gauteng\". His government would also build anti-corruption measures to tackle cases where they arose in big projects, investments and infrastructure development projects. He said he would be championing integrity. \"I have seen how it works in different countries like China where when you have huge public |resources being invested, you put together in that team that process an anti-corruption team right from the beginning of the project up to the end,\" he explained. \"We want to make sure that corruption is detected not when someone has stolen a billion rand and you send your guys to go catch the person. We have to build it into every phase of the process to ensure that any opportunists are caught early.\" And he issued a stern warning to public |servants and officials on the coal face of service |delivery. He said they must \"jerk up\" in every |sense of it. \"Twenty years into democracy we can\\'t take explanations why things cannot be done,\" he said. \"That\\'s why we say in hospitals, in schools, |in all government departments and institutions of the state, the only simple explanation we will |accept is when people say \\'we have done these things, premier\\'.\" Makhura said he was confident this team of MECs, whom he called \"the tried and tested\", understood their core issues and priorities. All the MECs he appointed, he said, would waste no time in getting back to communities crying about lack of development. He said things \"were going to be done differently\" but the comprehensive plan of his government would be outlined in his state of the province address. \"This team (the MECs) is capable and some of them have been in government for a long time,\" Makhura said.\n",

      "THE Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa (Hospersa), a union organising in the public and private health-care sector, as well as in tourism organisations such as SANParks and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, is becoming more concerned over the rate of infections of the Covid-19 virus in South Africa. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the virus a pandemic due to global figures. South Africa has several cases and it seems the virus is gaining momentum. Hospersa is calling on government to increase efforts of empowering health workers, especially front-line workers in clinics and hospitals, with the necessary knowledge, skills and resources to battle this virus. The union has supported the call by the Federation of Union South Africa to the Department of Labour minister to urgently consider intervention measures that will mitigate the impact of the potential effects of the virus South Africa. Hospersa has called on its members in the public and the private health sector, to take the necessary precautions in preventing the spread of the virus. The union has also called on the Department of Health to provide the protective clothing and training to health workers as they will be at the coal face of this virus when attending to suspected and confirmed cases. Hospersa calls on its members to promote prevention measures to stop the spread of the virus. We urge the government to take the lead in this venture, by ensuring that public health facilities are geared up with protective clothing and screening equipment for health workers. We demand that all health workers should be equipped with the knowledge and the necessary information tool-kits to deal with this virus. Private health organisations, who, in most instances, are profit-driven, should also take into cognisance the threat of a bigger outbreak to a country like ours and should assist government with preventative measures. Meanwhile, Fedusa, which Hospersa is affiliated to, has also called for a way in mobilising for a special Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) dispensation for workers affected by the coronavirus. Existing legislation does not make provision for workers who must be quarantined for compulsory 21 days after testing positive for the virus, to claim sick leave, nor be paid for the time that they are away from work. Fedusa has called on government to gazette a special policy that will activate a special UIF payment for quarantined workers.\n",

      "MANUFACTURING What the factory wants The surprise emergence of a manufacturing lobby, which has teamed up with trade unions to show support for the ideas being advocated by trade & industry minister Rob Davies and economic development minister Ebrahim Patel, shows what business wants from economic policy. In contrast to the approach of organised business and mainstream economists, which have for years expressed support for government\\'s policies on the rand and interest rates, the Manufacturing Circle this week called for the rand to be devalued and for a lower interest rate regime. The circle is a group of nine large manufacturers and the industry association for auto and component manufacturers. It has signed a declaration with the three major trade union federations and expressed strong support for Davies\\' Industrial Policy Action Plan (Ipap 2), published in February. The plan advocates the use of concessional, or discounted, financing from the state to encourage productive investment. It also aims to help local firms grow through government and state-owned enterprise procurement, particularly for the R800bn infrastructure investment programme. The declaration is \"the first platform between employers and unions\" and represents a real call on government to re-align its economic policies, says Cosatu economic adviser Neil Coleman. Stewart Jennings, CE of the PG Group and chairman of the Manufacturing Circle, says the strong rand and cheap, unfairly competitive imports prompted them to lobby for more favourable policies. \"There is an onslaught against manufacturing and so we hope we will get a hearing. But we face a lot of opposition,\" he says. \"Mainstream economists are against us and importers are against us. But if our exports are continually hammered then there won\\'t be much demand [for imports] in the future. \"We\\'ve got a lot of support from Rob Davies and Ebrahim Patel, but the national treasury has been intransigent.\" The group would like the rand \"linked to a basket of currencies\". Government should, at the very least, be talking down the rand. \"Patel has talked about the need for a weaker rand but treasury keeps on saying it is all right,\" says Jennings. \"There is no strong, united message coming out of government that we need a rand at R8,50 or R9 to the dollar. We are lobbying to intensify that debate.\" The Manufacturing Circle believes government\\'s policy perspective has been dominated by views from the financial sector rather than views from the real economy. Says Jennings: \"There is a real dichotomy in SA: on the one hand there is the stock market, which is booming, but the real economy has taken a battering. \"They are both important but they are out of sync. There is a big difference between the banking sector and the coal face.\" Though Davies\\'s Ipap 2 was endorsed by cabinet, it lacks a budget and national treasury has not committed funding for critical parts of the strategy. One objective of the joint declaration is to strengthen the lobby for more resources, calling on cabinet to ensure that all departments provide \"unqualified support for Ipap\" and for government to \"ensure that adequate resources are deployed to fund it and ensure its success\". The declaration backs Ipap\\'s call for \"preferential competitive procurement\" to promote locally manufactured goods. Though national treasury described his procurement proposals as \"unconstitutional\", Davies reiterated last week that the state\\'s procurement regime would change and discussions with treasury to draw up proposals were well advanced.

      "WHERE ARE THEY NOW? Information déj& 8364; vu As editors of most SA newspapers launch a campaign against what they are calling the greatest threat to a free press since democracy came to SA, for many such as Rex Gibson, there is a distinct sense of \"déj& 8364; vu\". As a former editor of the Rand Daily Mail and earlier of the Express and then deputy editor of The Star, Gibson was at the coal face of the apartheid era\\'s most vicious censorship laws. He remains one of the few editors to have been charged under the infamous Official Secrets Act, and also defended himself and his paper against the much rarer charge of criminal defamation. He was charged for running a story about SA apartheid-era spies operating out of the Seychelles, even though the story had been published in an Afrikaans newspaper. \"This was a classic pincer movement from the Nats,\" says Gibson. \"They took the view that we had made the story available to English-speaking readers.\" Gibson has joined respected former editors Harvey Tyson and Richard Steyn in opposing the restrictive clauses in the new Protection of Information Bill and the proposed media appeals tribunal. The tribunal is included in the proposed Protection of Information Act, which has already drawn wide local and international condemnation and protests. Gibson says the proposed new legislation, which government wants in place by the end of this year, harks back to that old repressive SA era and is a bid to curtail freedom of expression and the free flow of information. He says some of the top stories of the past year which exposed government corruption, tender fraud and even former police commissioner Jackie Selebi\\'s trial might not have been reported if this legislation had been in place already. Gibson, who retired from journalism in 1992, worries that, if passed, the act could sound the death knell for media freedom after just 16 years. \"This [new legislation] is as serious a threat [to press freedom], but at least this time we have much greater protection under our new constitution,\" says Gibson. After a short stint in public relations, Gibson has authored several books and is still intimately involved in media and journalism issues. Speaking from his home in Hermanus, he warns that successive apartheid governments tried no fewer than eight times in 48 years to enforce this kind of restriction on the press, and failed every time. \"Of course, the Nats believed they would be in power forever,\" says Gibson. \"And this is something the ANC needs to keep in mind.\" Rex Gibson Reminded of Nat days\n",

      ": Pattern Recognition Better than TV Never has such an unsexy technology been such a sexy story as the debate over the new digital plumbing to deliver television gets fiery It\\'s rough being a monopoly in SA these days. Everywhere you look, they are under attack. The SABC doesn\\'t think managers who can think are important. Eskom\\'s stranglehold on our economy continues as its flagship new power station Medupi, mired in delays and bad riveting, is held hostage by striking workers. Vodacom and MTN have taken to full-page newspaper ads to defend their massive margins on mobile calls, prompting a rush on newspaper advertising spend not seen since the Great Banking War of 2012. Even Cosatu\\'s monopoly on trade unions is under threat, replaced at the traditional coal face of strikes (in the mining sector) by that dangerous, strike-first, angry upstart Amcu. The ANC, also a monopolist of a sort, is on the back foot as it tries to explain away and defend the indefensible over Nkandla\\'s lavish spending. Thank god forThuli Madonsela.She is the Desmond Tutu of this generation. A fearless crusader for something ethical and honourable in a world gone mad with corruption and greed. Tutu fought against the injustice of apartheid and Madonsela fights against the destruction wrought by the tatty, tenderpreneur remnants of the once-mighty ANC, now a haven for thieves and liars. And then there\\'s MultiChoice. Last week the company - which has an unassailable monopoly in pay television and rights to all the sports, movie and news channels that matter - struck out at communications minister Yunus Carrim over plans to switch our TV signal. MultiChoice and e.tv have different reasons to be irked by the foot-dragging of the communications department in previous years over the critically important but often-ignored digital terrestrial television (DTT) switch-over. Despite being a signatory to the UN-backed umbrella body\\'s global switching date of November, the department under previous, ill-suited (and often scurrilous) ministers has been asleep at the wheel (not surprising, given the breadth of the government/monopoly) and missed every deadline. The current impasse is over whether set-top boxes (the technical term for decoders) should be encrypted or not. This is a valid and important argument which should have been settled years ago, instead of the preoccupation with Dina Pule\\'s relationships and red-soled shoes. But MultiChoice\\'s angry response to Carrim is disproportionately strong. And it\\'s always hard to feel sorry for monopolies - be they in business, telecoms or broadcasting - when they complain of \"narrow commercial interests\" (meaning e.tv) or when any company (including Cell C, with its 12m customers) is suddenly a friend of the \"consumer\". MultiChoice is obviously protecting its rather large monopoly on satellite pay-TV. And e.tv wants the decoders to include encryption because that will allow it to compete against the DStv parent in offering services that require the additional control that encryption offers. This is vastly simplifying the debate, but you have to feel for MultiChoice\\'s argument that e.tv is essentially asking government to fund a decoder rollout for its satellite plans, as well as services that require the so-called return path (a way for the viewer to send information back to the broadcaster). At the core should rather be concerns about future-proofing the decoders so that other services - including subscriptions to limit other countries hijacking a signal or even some broadband delivery - can ultimately be implemented. But these DTT delays have a more dangerous result, which is freeing up the current frequencies being used, which will be much better utilised for providing wireless broadband. There is little debate about the value of this \"digital dividend\" for these updated uses of the frequencies, but there needs to be some level-headedness and MultiChoice and e.tv need to find some middle ground. The squabble is better than actual television itself. Shapshak is editor and publisher of Stuff magazine (stuff.co.za). Follow him on Twitter: @shapshak\n",

The company\\'s made another loss for the year, but when you strip out discontinued operations it\\'s a lot closer to break even than the previous year, and tough decisions made have got the company heading back into positive territory. Perhaps we could hope for similar clarity and determination from our political overlords when they return from the election with a fresh mandate and set the country on course for the sustainable competitive advantages that we will need in future.

The problem is that every time there\\'s a new transport minister, a new plan is hatched. The taxi recapitalisation programme, launched in 2006, was supposed to entail the scrapping of old minibus taxis for new ones, to enhance safety and efficiency. Later, the revised taxi recapitalisation programme was launched under then transport minister Blade Nzimande. It included the aim of professionalising the industry and securing its entire value chain. What\\'s overlooked is the disjuncture between taxi operators and drivers. While the drivers aren\\'t unionised, taxi operators are organised in taxi associations. The government always negotiates with the associations, to the exclusion of the drivers who\\'re at the coal face of delivery. If any programme is to work, it must focus on defined timelines and achievable targets, not the personalities or programmes of particular ministers.

      "HOLDING COURT Mogoeng Mogoeng\\'s comment on Palestine, like Helen Zille\\'s on racist legislation, was an unnecessary attempt to inject his skewed belief system into the national dialogue Last week, I learnt a pithy Afrikaans saying: & Jy krap waar dit nie jeuk nie.& A direct translation would be something like: & You\\'re scratching where it doesn\\'t itch.& As far as I understand it, the idiom refers to the act of aggravating an itch that doesn\\'t exist - of worrying at a wound that isn\\'t really there. As you might have guessed, the person using it was talking about She Who Must Not Be Named, the DA\\'s Voldezille, who had decided to tell everyone that while she is out at the coal face saving the world from the racism of our government, her colleagues, like Phumzile van Damme, & chill at home and enjoy the sea view& Quite what Helen Zille has against sea views is a mystery, though one detects a whiff of that traditional cultural prejudice of the landlocked suburbanite for those who choose to live on the seaboard. But don\\'t groan, dear reader. This is not another column about the insanities and inanities of the DA\\'s federal council chair, though, like most columnists, I find it really hard to ignore low-hanging fruitcake. It is instead about the propensity of people to mysteriously decide they absolutely have to say something stupid, despite the fact that it\\'s going to cause a lot of controversy that nobody really needed. The recent prime example of that is God\\'s Judge, chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, who has decided - possibly with justification - that two books cobbled together over the centuries by a selection of politically driven chancers, deranged mystics and church clerks is a better arbiter of human rights issues than the constitutionally driven government of SA. And who among us can say he is wrong? I mean, besides the 5% or so of South Africans who don\\'t identify as religious, and the no doubt many perturbed Christians with a slightly more realistic view of the elasticity of exegesis in their source material. According to the chief justice, the Bible\\'s take on human rights supersedes that of the SA constitution. Now, there are many ways to draw very positive messages about human rights from the Bible, but there are also very many ways to justify crimes against humanity, such as genocide, homophobia, apartheid or Donald Trump. It\\'s not exactly a coherently constructed document, and only the convenient fiction of faith can allow anyone to claim any sort of ideological exactitude. Allow ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe to remind you of our government\\'s standpoint. & We support human rights and we stand with the oppressed Palestinians who include Christians of the Holy Land, as well as the residents of Jerusalem and Bethlehem who are living under Israeli apartheid.& The chief justice\\'s argument against the SA government\\'s official standpoint is drawn from Genesis and the Psalms. To quote his online interview with the Jerusalem Post, whose editor clearly couldn\\'t believe his luck: & Let me acknowledge without any equivocation that the policy decision taken by my country is binding on me. & So anything I say must not be misconstrued as me saying that my country\\'s laws are not binding on me. But ... as a citizen I can suggest that changes are necessary ... & Let me give the base. The first base I need is in Psalm 122:6 which says: \\'Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. They shall prosper that love thee.\\' & Also Genesis 12:1-3, that says to me as a Christian, that if I curse Abraham and Israel, God, the Almighty God, will curse me too. So I am under an obligation as a Christian.& It all seems an oddly self-serving set of biblical justifications; if I take Israel\\'s side, I\\'ll prosper. If I don\\'t take Israel\\'s side, God will curse me. It\\'s a rewards-driven way of thinking shared by Mogoeng\\'s supporters, including Klaas Mokgomole and Mmamalema Molepo of the group Africans for Peace, who tell us: & By merely expressing his religious views that do not infringe on the rights of others nor advocate incitement to cause harm, chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has had many an insult hurled at him. The chief justice is not money and cannot seek to please everyone.& Does money please everyone? That seems a strange point of view, and possibly a bit more revealing about the nature of belief as currency than intended. The chief justice doesn\\'t appear to be a huge fan of the ANC\\'s attempts to rectify the injustices of apartheid. & Come to SA,& he invited the grateful editor in chief of the Jerusalem Post, & and see how the overwhelming majority of people live in shacks, how the overwhelming majority of people of a particular race are unemployed, are living in abject poverty. & Where is the movement for that, where is the [audio is unclear] campaign for that, where is the pointed campaign for the injection of hope and broader healing, and restoration of the dignity of the people of SA?& I mean, I thought it was called the reconstruction & development programme, but I admit I haven\\'t been keeping up with government promises of late. Who can stand the constant disappointment? Zille believes we have more racist laws now than we did under apartheid. While this might be blindingly stupid, it at least still acknowledges that the law is the law. Our antinomian chief justice appears to be pulling a Gallio (proconsul of Achaea in 51 CE, I\\'m sure I don\\'t need to remind you - Acts 18:12-16), and seems to be a proponent of the attitude to the law embodied in Galatians 3:23-25. & Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.& Which is sort of talking himself out of a job, if you think about it. Why should we worry about a chief justice\\'s personal belief system, you ask? One answer comes from the ANC\\'s Mabe. & The chief justice ... is the primary protector of the constitution of SA and if the government was in violation of the Bill of Rights, he and the bench must defend the constitution above all else and any other consideration. For this reason, his disagreement with the policy of the government is of grave concern, where the main argument of the policy on Palestine is premised on human rights.& But, also, once you\\'ve decided that your interpretation of the Bible is as relevant as the law, you end up saying things like this: & Leaders [are] saying so many people are affected by coronavirus, so many people are going to die. They are even prophesying they know how many people are going to die. I don\\'t know how they know that. & Now, because of those words that are consistently pumped into the media platforms, they enter the heart of the people, they enter the minds of the people. & So everybody is trembling, even the people of faith, where boldness is supposed to be found, suddenly the faith that they used to have in the Almighty God is not there any more.& The idea that science-based extrapolation is described as & prophecy& is scary enough, with its suggestion that prophecy and science are similar. Even more disturbing, though, is the assumption that the media is fear-mongering with all this Covid-19 nonsense, and that people of faith shouldn\\'t be trembling - for some God-given reason of immunity, one assumes. Mogoeng\\'s argument isn\\'t quite as crude as these extracts paint, of course. But as with Zille\\'s contention that there are more racist laws now than there were under apartheid, his very intervention is so unnecessary, and appears to be premised on the same impulse as Zille\\'s. That is, an attempt to inject one\\'s own skewed belief system into the national dialogue by virtue of a provocative and ultimately indefensible proposition that doesn\\'t really do your primary argument any benefit. All that does is get everyone itchy for a while, to no ultimate good. Gallo Images/Busisiwe Mbatha\n",

      "The one-stop shop solution This is still the largest sector of SA unit trusts, at R493bn, though money market funds are catching up fast. The high equity funds lost R18bn last year and at current trends the fast-growing money market funds will overtake them in about a year\\'s time. These funds hold R422bn at present. As Karl Leinberger, chief investment officer of Coronation, points out that the trend away from one-stop multi asset funds has been driven by the growth of designated fund managers. They are hired by financial advisers to help construct more sophisticated portfolios, with separate fund managers who run equities and bond and cash managers, and even help them buy alternative assets. Big players in this space include PortfolioMetrix, Fundhouse and Morningstar Investment Management. But for many advisers and direct clients the one-stop solution makes sense; even splitting between two or three balanced funds does. After all, a large amount of pension money is managed that way. And there is a strong argument that fund managers at the coal face are better at running asset allocation than the discretionary fund managers who are dominated by former pension fund consultants and unit trust marketers. High equity funds are considered & domestic& they cannot be invested more than 30% in international assets and may not be more than 75% invested in equities. & Foreign& assets, of course, do not include shares which earn little rand income and happen to be listed on the JSE. It is no surprise that Quilter, a UK-based wealth manager, has been one of the best-performing financial shares; and there is little SA-based business generated by Naspers, Richemont or British American Tobacco. High equity funds do not have a minimum, and can go down to zero equity, but most have 35%- 45% in local equity and 20%-30% in offshore equity. In the past, asset allocation was often a consequence of buying bonds to fill the gaps when opportunities on the JSE were limited. More recently there has been a revival of top-down investment. Balanced funds have far more than the traditional 60% equity-40% bonds mix. There is the offshore/onshore decision to be made. Property has become a distinct alternative, though it\\'s now out of favour, and houses need to decide between fixed, floating and inflation-linked bonds and a whole array of convertibles. This month we look at five quite different funds that are at various points in their life cycle. The & incumbent& is Coronation Balanced Plus, the second-largest balanced fund in SA. It doesn\\'t have much to prove and therefore has a great deal to lose. In spite of its size it has not become a closet index tracker, and its asset allocation is active. Leinberger says the ability to engage in dynamic asset allocation is a key differentiator between active funds and index funds. Another established fund, though much smaller, is Stanlib Balanced. It has in the past had a patchy track record, as the culture at Stanlib, a unit of Liberty Life, has been more bureaucratic and indecisive than that at Coronation - with the expected results. But it looks much more competitive and energetic under the leadership of Mark Lovett and Giles Heeger, with old hand Herman van Velze playing a decisive role as head of the balanced and equity teams. Ashburton is the FirstRand Group\\'s institutional asset manager, and its balanced fund is a work in progress. But it is still worth watching, as it is one of the few funds that explicitly weights top-down macro research higher than bottom up. Much of the Ashburton team, including Wayne McCurrie, have been redeployed to FNB Wealth, a much more profitable operation. The other two funds reviewed, Northstar and Perpetua, can be called cousins of Ashburton, as their major shareholder is Rand Merchant Investment, which has its origins as part of FirstRand\\'s old controlling shareholder, RMB Holdings. In fact, for a split funder the two shops would be a great choice. Northstar follows the & quality& approach (not that it always guarantees a quality outcome) and Perpetua an old school (though intelligent) value approach. NorthStar has strong leadership through Adrian Clayton, who used to head the PSG Asset Management team, and Perpetua has the highly competent Delphine Govender. But don\\'t make a choice without seeking professional financial advice.\n",

      "MINING Mined commodities did extraordinarily well in 2020, despite the Covid chaos. Precious metals continued a winning streak that started in 2019. Platinum group metals fared particularly well, thanks largely to palladium and rhodium prices, which reached record highs. Platinum also did well, breaching $1,050/oz for the first time in more than four years. Global uncertainty meant gold prices hit record highs, while rand gold prices shot the lights out. Iron ore continued a marvellous run, thanks to unrelenting demand from China. Despite major production losses, largely due to Covid-related disruptions, stellar prices ensured shares excelled. Anglo American\\'s share price is 41% higher than a year ago and its platinum business is up 9.5%; Impala Platinum\\'s share is also 39% higher. Last year, AngloGold Ashanti\\'s share price rose 10%, Harmony\\'s 35% and Gold Fields\\' 55%. Kumba gained almost 60%, while Sibanye-Stillwater stock rose 70%. With cheap money washing around the globe and growth-led demand from China, commodities look set for a good year. Coal faces growing negative sentiment, but dwindling production could buoy prices in the medium term. In SA, a number of challenges remain. Port and rail infrastructure is a thorn in the sector\\'s side, and local content quotas are likely to be a hot topic. For operations on the edge, rising Eskom tariffs may prove to be the death knell.\n",

      "at home & abroad by DEATH BY A THOUSAND COMMITTEES It seems whenever there is a problem the president appoints an advisory council - and there are problems everywhere Look, one day soon you might find yourself in business class, on a flight to Cape Town or Joburg. An enthusiastic air steward might offer you a glass of champagne. We now know that a pandemic might hit any minute, so accept the champagne with a measure of grace. Life really is short. Ask for a second glass. Then say hello to the person sitting next to you. If you are flying SAA (cough, cough, cue nervous laughter), the lucky person next to you will be someone in government, probably a minister or director-general. Don\\'t ask them for their card. Ask them who their boss is. Because, in our new world, the minister or DG is not in charge of whatever they are supposed to be in charge of. There is an advisory council peering over their shoulder. That seems to be the new way of doing things. Whenever there is a problem, the president appoints an advisory council. And because there are problems everywhere, the president appoints an advisory council for pretty much everything. My question is: what are all those hundreds of thousands of expensive public servants doing? You think I am exaggerating? Come with me as we take a look at Thoko Didiza. I have been a fan of Didiza, our minister of agriculture, land reform & rural development, since the 1990s. She served in the role in the Mbeki administration and was a steady, considered, assured & deliverer& No frills, just good, hard, steady work. She is sharp and dedicated and hardworking. She deserves to be in the cabinet. Yet, despite her expertise and intellectual gifts, she will no longer be making the big decisions. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced last week that & we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform& I don\\'t understand: what are all the clever civil servants who\\'ve been working at the coal face of land reform going to be doing now? I thought we were trimming the civil service? What, pray tell, is Pravin Gordhan\\'s job as public enterprises minister? If I were him I would tell Ramaphosa to take his job back because, well, decisions are being made not by the minister but by a & presidential state-owned enterprises council& I tell you, I will never again criticise Gordhan for SAA or Eskom or the like. I am going to look around for the real power: this presidential state-owned enterprises council that Ramaphosa has put his faith in. Last week Ramaphosa told us that & to support our reform process, the presidential state-owned enterprises council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development& Nice. I can\\'t wait. We have some of the smartest people in the country grafting away at the National Treasury. They are supposedly carrying out the mandate of the party that won an election in 2019 - the ANC. Yet the minute the ANC comes into power it appoints a presidential economic advisory council. And a presidential advisory committee on land (no, not the new agency referred to above - a different one). So why was Ramaphosa elected if he is scrambling around for new policy after election? He had no policy? No plan? Here\\'s an anecdote. Last Friday the ANC\\'s top 26 leaders had to decide: should leaders facing serious criminal charges step aside from their positions? For most organisations this would be a simple issue. Guided by ethics and organisational discipline, of course a leader facing such charges would step aside so as not to sully his comrades\\' work, distract them or send a message to members that such behaviour is acceptable. The 26 ANC leaders refused to discuss it. They said it should be discussed by the entire National Executive Committee of the party. That\\'s the 108 or so top leaders, including Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki, who are members by virtue of their being past presidents of the party. They kicked it upstairs. Those 108 quislings will find a way to kick it to the 2022 ANC elective conference for ratification. Or a committee. There isn\\'t a single backbone in the room. Just advisers. These 26 leaders could not make a simple decision because there isn\\'t a single backbone in the room\n",

      "DIGITAL 5G\\'s glittering engagement with gems Jwaneng, the world\\'s richest diamond mine, is embracing hi-tech to improve safety and streamline operations DIGITAL Most people associate 5G mobile with social media and watching YouTube faster. But the super-fast technology also has significant benefits for business and industry, with private 5G networks forming the cornerstone of the fourth industrial revolution. Digital automation requires fast wireless with low latency (delay) for such applications as monitoring surveillance cameras and processing the huge amount of data they generate. One of the new uses of these 5G networks is in mining, where it is streamlining operations and improving the safety of mineworkers. In Botswana, Debswana introduced this hi-tech solution for the challenges of an ancient industry at its Jwaneng open-pit diamond mine in December 2021. The network was set up by Huawei, which has extensive experience with similar installations in Chinese mines. It connects a variety of hi-tech and low-tech components, combining several wireless networks into one system. \"We are a technology company that is doing mining,\" Debswana\\'s head of information management, Molemisi Sechaba, tells the FM. He says the mine contributes 30% of Botswana\\'s GDP, 32% of government revenue and more than 70% of foreign earnings. \"We have to make sure this asset is sustainable,\" he says. Sechaba describes the upgrades at Jwaneng as a \"digital transformation project, using technology at its core\". Debswana sent staff to \"Australia, to Mongolia, to touch and feel a connectivity solution that meets our requirement\", and chose Huawei, says Sechaba. \"We are convinced we did not make a mistake.\" Debswana will install similar smart-mining systems at its Orapa, Damtshaa and Letlhakane mines later this year. Xu Jun, chief technology officer for Huawei\\'s intelligent mining division, tells the FM the Jwaneng mine is the \"world\\'s first 5G-orientated smart diamond mine\". He says the tech firm built a mining technology group after many Chinese mines asked how Huawei could apply its enterprise offerings to the industry. In the past five years it has provided these services in South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Namibia and Ghana. However, Xu says the \"mining industry is behind in digital transformation\" compared with other sectors. Part of the problem for mining firms is the high number of networks they use for communication and telematics. \"It\\'s not easy. There are so many networks - for video, for emergencies, for production. How do you consolidate all of these and have a unified network?\" Another concern, he says, is that most mining houses don\\'t have adequate IT staff. To address this, Huawei has developed a low- or no-code platform for mines. This allows them to drag and drop processes or instructions to create a new way of automating an operation, or a series of them. For Sechaba, the most important result has been a reduction in accidents. Debswana has seen safety improve \"because of the technology we have employed, including collision avoidance systems\". He says data has grown in importance for Debswana, and \"if you can\\'t measure it, you can\\'t manage it\". Botswana has mostly open-pit mines, which are safer than deep underground mines. Huawei has implemented its wireless systems in many deep coal mines in China, Xu says. Streaming high-definition video cameras monitor the automated drilling equipment that reduces the need for humans at the relatively dangerous coalface. There are additional benefits for Botswana, says the minister of transport & communications, Thulagano Segokgo. Speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, he said the mine\\'s upgrade process provided an opportunity to drive other connectivity projects. Botswana runs a connectivity project for villages with over 500 people receiving free super-fast connectivity of 100MB/s. Health facilities and all public schools are also connected Pioneer: Jwaneng mine, 160km southwest of Gaborone, is the world\\'s first 5G-orientated smart diamond mine AFP/Alexander Joe\n",

      "A SANDBANK HALTING THE SLIDE TO MUNICIPAL DEVASTATION Tsakani Maluleke appeared as a beacon last week to South Africans rapidly losing faith that our municipalities, and service delivery, can be saved. Here, the auditor-general tells the FM why there\\'s reason for hope - and elaborates on the three interventions that could turn things around Natasha Marrian & Rob Rose Municipalities - which stand at the coal face of delivery for 60-million South Africans - are rapidly unravelling. And while you\\'d imagine the country\\'s auditor-general (AG), Tsakani Maluleke, would be watching this with a growing sense of despondency, she\\'s doing her best to find the glimmers of hope amid the wreckage. \"Most of the municipalities are not moving in the right direction, but there are a few that are starting to listen,\" she tells the FM in an interview. \"You give recommendations, and you solicit commitments, and then you hope and trust that people implement them. And when they don\\'t, it just makes the situation even worse. I don\\'t get frustrated - I don\\'t think frustration is a helpful way to respond to the moment.\" It\\'s a necessary view of what would otherwise be perhaps the most thankless job in the country - on a par with the role of Eskom CEO recently vacated by André de Ruyter, or the chair of the ANC\\'s integrity committee. Maluleke is in the third year of a seven-year term as the head of South Africa\\'s state-run auditing office, tasked with verifying and signing off on the accounts of every government agency, department and state-owned entity. As the country\\'s supreme audit institution, her office is tasked with ensuring accountability in a government that has shown that the one thing it really doesn\\'t like is to be held accountable. This was starkly evident in her crisp 144-page report on municipalities, presented to parliament last week, which revealed the deep rot at the heart of service delivery. Consider the \"highlights\": of the country\\'s 257 municipalities, only 38 got a clean audit (down from 41); nearly three in four didn\\'t have proper financial controls in place; irregular spending ballooned to R136bn; only two of the eight metros (Cape Town and Ekurhuleni) got a \"clean audit\"; fruitless and wasteful expenditure more than doubled to R4.7bn; and in 27% of the municipalities the signs were so ominous that there was \"significant doubt\" that they could continue operating much longer. It was so gruesome that Zoliswa Kota-Mpeko, an MP from the governing ANC, which bears most responsibility for this state, said: \"Let\\'s dump this nonsense of doing what we like - the people want services and they want them now.\" The decline was evident as far back as 2012, when then-AG Terence Nombembe released a report that revealed just 13 of 343 municipalities got clean audits, while nearly 20% had disclaimers. The red lights were blinking, but in the decade since, the country\\'s political leaders looked the other way. Nor are these just numbers: they are a reflection of the experiences of South Africans who, in many instances, are paying for services they\\'re not getting. Kevin Allan, head of Municipal IQ, which assesses the performance of all the country\\'s municipalities, says that to dismiss Maluleke\\'s report as simply a technical financial report would be to understate the deep problems in our economy, which it lays bare. \"It manifests in what we saw in Tshwane in recent weeks, where the failure of municipalities to manage the engineering function they\\'re responsible for has led to a completely avoidable cholera outbreak [in which 26 people have died so far].\" This was the responsibility of the Tshwane metro, where the red flags had first been raised over the Rooiwal waste water treatment plant back in 2004. And it was made all the worse by a R250m tender awarded four years ago to a joint venture of CMS Water, NJR and Blackhead Consulting, run by state capture-implicated businessman Edwin Sodi. That project was never completed. Allan says Maluleke\\'s reports don\\'t sugar-coat the collapse in municipalities. \"The fact is, everyone who pays taxes is paying for this local government failure, either directly because they live there and services have dried up, or indirectly, because the national government has to step in to provide financial support for those municipalities,\" he says. It\\'s a trajectory at the end of which lies the implosion of services in outlying areas - no roads, no water, no power, with residents and businesses fleeing to the larger metros that can support them. \"You can\\'t have a successful country if your local economies are failing, and my concern is the government just doesn\\'t seem to realise this, and the risk this poses to the wider country,\" says Allan. Maluleke\\'s report also accords with the diagnosis of other agencies. Last month, Ratings Afrika released its annual report into the state of 112 municipalities, which concluded that a \"majority ... are on the brink of becoming dysfunctional\", with only those in the Western Cape demonstrating \"adequate levels of financial sustainability\". More disturbing was the trajectory: those 112 municipalities had a combined R33.7bn operating deficit - more than double the R15bn deficit five years before. The shortfall in working capital - essentially, money needed to pay service providers such as Eskom, and to invest in infrastructure - had nearly tripled to R65bn. \"An audit is simply accounting for money spent in a financial year; it\\'s not building a rocket ship to Mars,\" says Allan. \"The [AG] comes in and says: \\'Tell us what you spend and how you account for it\\', and the vast majority of municipalities can\\'t do that - because government just doesn\\'t take auditing seriously.\" Ask Maluleke about this, and she\\'ll talk gamely of how her 3,600 staff \"work hard to keep finding spaces where there is momentum, and where there is some responsiveness - and there\\'s always some\". Though she chooses her words with the deliberation and poise you\\'d expect of a seasoned accountant, these pockets of momentum are becoming increasingly hard to find. \\'We\\'re no messiah\\' Maluleke\\'s optimism is all the more noticeable since she\\'s had a front-row seat to this unravelling. Back in 2012, when Nombembe presented his alarming diagnosis, few would have noticed the quiet chartered accountant who\\'d joined his office just a month before, but who would later become the first woman to hold that position, in 2020. But even then she seemed destined for greater things. Having trained at PwC, she cut her teeth in various corporate roles, including as finance director of Sipho Pityana\\'s Izingwe Holdings, an audit partner at Deloitte, and as chair of the SA Institute of Chartered Accountants. Achievement is in her genes. Her father, George Maluleke, served as a judge of the high court from 1993 to his retirement in 2016; her sister Basani became the first black female head of a major bank (at African Bank) before she moved to Capitec as an executive in 2021; and her youngest sister Refilwe is the MD of marketing company Yellowwood. It was Maluleke\\'s unruffled demeanour in the way she presented her findings last week, to the very politicians who\\'d caused the mess, that stoked the view of her office as a beacon of hope in a bleak landscape, and as a bulwark against unbridled corruption. In much the same way that people saw Thuli Madonsela as a messiah during her tenure as public protector, Maluleke\\'s office has been depicted as the final sandbank between South Africa and the slide to a failed state. This burden of expectation, Maluleke tells the FM, is huge but ill-placed. \"It is problematic because it starts to shape a narrative that says we\\'re waiting for a messiah or saviour,\" she says. \"And that\\'s not helpful for the office, and not helpful for our democracy. There are different role players in the accountability ecosystem that must do their part. \"When people say to us, \\'we want to see people in jail\\' - we don\\'t get to put people in handcuffs, as good as we are as auditors ... Or they\\'ll say, \\'we want you to make sure that people are held accountable\\' - but all we can do is complement the system.\" And that is where that ecosystem can break down. For example, Maluleke\\'s powers were widely extended two years ago, to give her office greater powers of investigation and to allow it to make referrals to criminal authorities, such as the Hawks, when corruption has been detected. But once a case has been referred, her office has zero control of the pace of those investigations. This is a necessary limitation, says Maluleke. \"The people who work here went to school to become auditors, not investigators. Their inclination is to get excited about auditing, and not about carrying revolvers.\" This year, however, she\\'s seen a distinct change; municipal accounting officers themselves are referring cases to the criminal authorities. \"Many of them are moving in terms of getting matters investigated, dealing with disciplinary issues, cancelling contracts, getting money back into their coffers. And naturally, we would want to see more of that,\" she says. Ratings Afrika analyst Leon Claassen says Maluleke is doing a fine job, \"but she should perhaps be qualifying more municipal accounts, since there\\'s no way most of these municipalities are a going concern - they\\'re hopelessly commercially bankrupt, and there\\'s no likelihood that they\\'ll be able to trade out of that position.\" Allan agrees that there\\'s a huge weight of expectation on the AG office - but this is inevitable, as it\\'s one of the few state bodies holding anyone accountable. \"Maluleke is very courageous, and scathing where it\\'s necessary - which is, actually, all the time, since local government is under serious pressure and is failing in many areas. She rightly identified the root causes as inadequate skills and capacity, governance failures and a lack of accountability as the reason for this.\" Yet she can only do so much. The problem may begin in the municipalities, but culpability also needs to lie with the provinces they report to, and the National Treasury, which ultimately approves budgets it must know aren\\'t practical. Budgetary fairy tales Leaping off just about every page of Maluleke\\'s report is the clear message that the basic level of financial planning skills is entirely absent in many municipalities. One of the more troubling findings is that 44% of municipalities have \"unfunded budgets\", where they overestimate the revenue they plan to collect in order to justify their sky-high spending. But when the inevitable happens, and they don\\'t hit their targets, cash dries up for services and to pay creditors. Maluleke says that in too many instances, municipal officials know, right from the start of their budgeting process, that they won\\'t get the revenue they\\'re hoping for. \"It is significant - you\\'re essentially working yourself into an operational loss, or a deficit and a liquidity crunch. And then the impact is not just a weak balance sheet, but service delivery suffers.\" Allan says these unfunded budgets reveal inept financial planning. \"It\\'s deeply worrying that, in the vast majority of cases, there isn\\'t enough money coming in to provide services and to maintain infrastructure and, instead, that money is being spent on salaries. In the most glaring failing municipalities, you see administration buildings bursting at the seams with a bloated staff amid a sea of failure outside those walls,\" he says. Perhaps the most blatant example is the bankrupt Amathole district municipality in the Eastern Cape, centred on East London. In 2021 it needed a R180m government bailout to pay salaries for a bloated staff of 1,670 - even as it sought to hire a \"political adviser to the mayor\" for R1.5m a year. This is the kind of unaccountable largesse that should end in municipal officials being fired, but rarely does. Instead, the country\\'s political leaders wring their hands and mouth platitudes, rather than acting decisively. President Cyril Ramaphosa, writing in his newsletter this week, said Maluleke\\'s finding that only 38 of the country\\'s 257 municipalities got clean audits is \"worrying\" and requires a \"co-ordinated response\" from the government. Where councils have got it right, it seems to be through their own efforts, not thanks to any help from Ramaphosa\\'s administration. If anything, the government\\'s unwillingness to cut dead wood or, worse, those blocking reform, is standing in the way of progress. Says Allan: \"When there is demonstrable incompetence or mismanagement, how come there is no accountability? In two provinces - North West and the Free State - the provincial MECs for co-operative governance [& traditional affairs, Cogta] must also be held responsible for the failure of oversight. Why is no-one fired?\" In North West, Nono Maloyi has been the Cogta MEC for seven months; in the Free State, Toto Makume has been MEC for about two months, but his predecessor, Mxolisi Dukwana, who held the post for 18 months, is now the premier of the economically delinquent province. \"When an entire province isn\\'t adhering to audit processes, ultimately the buck stops with the national minister of co-operative governance. It\\'s their responsibility to step in and ensure accountability,\" Allan says. In other words, minister Thembi Nkadimeng, and her long-standing predecessor Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, should be held responsible for not stopping the long slow puncture of local government. There are some interesting ideas floating about. The South African Local Government Association\\'s Sivuyile Mbambato, for instance, tells the FM his organisation plans to bring back experienced former councillors with good track records to help troubled municipalities implement better oversight. The government also says the right things. Nkadimeng\\'s spokesperson Tsekiso Machike tells the FM the framework for professionalising the public service was adopted by the cabinet last year, requiring managers across all three spheres of government to be appointed on merit. Of course, political instability - and coalitions - don\\'t help. In Tshwane and Joburg, factional fights leave the civil service with poor oversight, and little confidence that they won\\'t just be replaced when a new party wrests control. Machike tells the FM that Nkadimeng is working on legal changes to ensure \"stability\" in local government that should be passed before the 2026 local government elections. But when the rubber hits the road, there\\'s plenty of scepticism about whether it will actually happen. If there were any urgency, critics ask, why wasn\\'t this process started a decade ago? A recipe for municipal success From the outside, it may seem like an unsolvable dilemma. But Maluleke has provided a recipe of sorts to fix municipalities, starting with three key interventions. First, people must be appointed to critical positions because they are competent - not just because they are aligned to the politics of the day. She says: \"We have some way to go to get to the point where political leadership will appoint professionals who, despite what they believe politically, are actually able to do the work.\" Second, civil servants need to be confident they\\'ll have secure tenure to ensure councils are stable. \"The municipalities with the clean audits, and the ones that maintain clean audits, have municipal managers and chief financial officers who stay longer than five years\" she says. \"And the reverse is also true: where there\\'s dysfunction, where there are disclaimers and adverse opinions, that\\'s where you\\'ve had significant churn at those levels.\" Third, she says, there have to be consequences for people who mess up - accountability, in other words. It is, Maluleke says, about \"thinking technocratically\" - a skill that can actually enhance the political standing of a municipality, rather than detract from it. \"I would think that any politician wants to be associated with a public institution that delivers on the promises made - so if you hire for competence, you\\'re clear about the direction that has been set, and you oversee to ensure things are running in the way that you expect, I would have assumed that\\'s what you\\'d want if you\\'re politically ambitious,\" she says. If delinquent municipalities were serious about cleaning themselves up, there are a few examples they could emulate. Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis tells the FM that clean governance is a \"culture\" established over time. The prerequisites for creating that culture include professionalism among city officials and firewalling the procurement processes. It\\'s a point echoed by Mzusekho Matomane, CFO at the Mnquma local municipality, which encompasses the town of Butterworth in the Eastern Cape. Mnquma is one of the vanishingly few municipal success stories. It went from a disclaimer six years ago to a clean audit now (see story on page 27). Matomane says when he took over as CFO after the 2016 local election, when a new city manager was appointed, the council had just R7,000 in the bank. Today, it has a surplus of R169m, which it can use to build infrastructure and deliver services. \"Politicians have to give administrators the space to implement controls - it\\'s as simple as that,\" he says. To get to a clean audit, Mnquma\\'s finance team worked closely with Maluleke\\'s office, refining its processes to the extent that it has been able to eliminate fruitless and wasteful spending. Matomane says risks of political interference remain, but he credits the municipal manager for taking a hard line against that. Ratings Afrika\\'s Claassen relates the story of Theewaterskloof, in the Overberg region of the Western Cape, which encompasses Caledon, Grabouw, Villiersdorp, Greyton and Botrivier. \"Back in 2011, they got a very low score from us - 23 out of 100 - and the municipal manager was very upset, and called to speak to us about it. We explained, and the penny dropped about how bad their situation was. But they took ownership of it: they cut back on unnecessary expenses, did what they could to draw investment back in, and focused on collecting their debts,\" he says. In this year\\'s Ratings Afrika report, Theewaterskloof scored 55/100 - a remarkable turnaround. Says Claassen: \"Theewaterskloof was not a rich municipality, but they realised they had to go back to the basics: put in place proper financial planning, management and fiscal discipline. It\\'s really that simple. But it takes political will, and I think many municipalities don\\'t have that will.\" It\\'s a point Maluleke stresses often: fixing South Africa\\'s municipalities, filling in potholes, and delivering services, all begin with leadership. \"We\\'re not auditing in just theoretical terms. We want to impact and influence things so that the right choices are made by those who run the government. We want people to understand what it means on the ground, so they can understand why they shouldn\\'t tolerate [living in a municipality] with a disclaimer on their accounts,\" she says.

      "After years underground, E Cape farmer now shooting highWEEKEND POST REPORTERharveyj@avusa.co.zaA SCENE involving a movie producer mingling with ducks and a pet calf on a quaint eco-farm may sound like it has been scripted by some off-beat Hollywood screenwriter, but in the case of former miner turned Eastern Cape farmer, Lukas van der Merwe, the truth really is stranger than fiction. Having devoted years of blood, sweat and tears \"underground\" to the gold reefs of Gauteng, the affable Van der Merwe, thanks to his tireless work ethic, engineering ingenuity and business acumen, is now a very \"comfortable\" man who has decided to spend his golden years on a farm in the Elands River Valley, about 90km from Port Elizabeth.But where for some sitting back and enjoying the fruits of their labour may suffice during retirement, Van der Merwe has decided to pursue one of his lifelong interests - the art of storytelling through film - although clearly this is no ordinary hobby, as few would bet against him becoming Nelson Mandela Bay\\'s own \"Mr Hollywood\".Together with celebrated SA director Vickus Strydom and producer Bertus van der Walt, Van der Merwe is the brains behind the film Zama Zama, a full-length feature exploring the hardships of illegal miners on the Reef. It stars Tsotsi actor Presley Chweneyagae.\"I was always interested in film, and made a lot of home movies over the years,\" Van der Merwe said this week.\"For the past 32 years I have been involved in hunting for treasure with a metal detector and as a result managed to travel extensively overseas and link up with a British group.\"Together we started making marketing videos, showing people what we do and what we have discovered.\"I then met up with Vickus, who directed (popular SA soapie) Villa Rosa. During one of his visits to the farm I mentioned to him I would love to make a movie about the illegal miners because I had got to know them while working alongside them underground, and saw the difficulties they faced. This is how I became an executive producer.\"His investment, which runs into tens of millions of rands, resulted in several locations - including Gold Reef City - being secured. Shooting began last year, with the film now in post-production. \"The premiere is scheduled for the Berlin Film Festival in February and then we are hoping to screen it at all the major European film festivals, including Cannes.\"Producer Van der Walt said it was ironic that mining was arguably SA\\'s most important industry, yet so little was reported on the plight of those at the coal face of operations.\"The stories of abuse and criminality that emerge are quite horrific, and they are definitely ones the audience should be made aware of,\" he said.\"I think what is especially exciting is that SA now has the ability to tell these stories properly through film, because the local industry is flourishing.\"However, for Van der Merwe Zama Zama seems to be just the beginning. An as yet untitled new project seeks to tell the story of the Johannesburg underworld and the mysterious events that surrounded the death of mining magnate Brett Kebble - a film that has already attracted the attentions of several \"very well-known Hollywood producers\".\"We will be meeting a few of them towards the end of the year, so ja, things seem to be moving along nicely,\" Van Der Merwe said.

      "Chamber president pledges efforts in 2014 to make \\'city the place it should be\\'Our call was \\'enough is enough\\'. It is time the concerns of civil society and business in Nelson Mandela Bay are taken seriouslyHAVING rocked the boat on a number of occasions this year, organised business in Nelson Mandela Bay plans to make its voice heard even more in 2014. No-nonsense Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber president Mandla Madwara said next year would be an important milestone not only because South Africa would celebrate 20 years of democracy but because the chamber would celebrate 150 years of championing business issues.Madwara was addressing councillors from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and more than 800 business leaders at the annual chamber banquet at the Boardwalk International Convention Centre last night.The event is considered the highlight of the annual business calendar.Madwara said \"2014 will be year of big decisions, it will be a year of hope for Nelson Mandela Bay. A year of growth, and a year of celebration\".\"As people of influence, we will answer the call to pull together to move this country forward.\"We pledge to channel our efforts towards building the Bay into the kind of city we believe it could be.\"The kind of city it is meant to be - unencumbered by poor service delivery or a lack of good governance.\"It was \"a watershed moment\" in May when the chamber led civil-society organisations in discussions with the council regarding the political situation in the metro.As a result, the Civil Society Coalition was formed to address the challenges of organisational instability in the municipality and poor infrastructure and basic services.\"Our call was \\'enough is enough\\'. It is time, we believe, that the concerns of civil society and business in Nelson Mandela Bay are taken seriously. Despite promises that the metro would have the benefit of a permanent city manager by the end of the year, we have neither a permanent city manager nor a permanent chief financial officer.\"We acknowledge, however, that the metro has committed to working with us to ensure that we build a competitive and sustainable city, and to create an enabling environment for business and investors,\" Madwara said.The chamber had, for the first time, ventured into supportive litigation as a co-applicant with member companies against the manner in which municipal tariffs were set by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa.Madwara said this bold step was taken by the chamber to defend members against increasing electricity costs and \"in the interest of protecting companies in our region from potential closure, the loss of jobs and revenue, resulting in a downward spiral of the Eastern Cape economy\". He said despite economic uncertainty in the Bay and in the global arena, with \"businesses among us operating on a knife\\'s edge\", positive change had been achieved over the past 20 years with the tripling of the gross domestic product, a substantial rise in the middle class and inflation falling from 14% to 6%.\"When we are at the coal face, it is difficult to see these changes - they are small and incremental.\"But, they paint a bigger picture of hope,\" Madwara said.He said some of the most impressive economic gains for the region had been at Coega, with investments by Afrox, Air Products, Coega Dairy, DCD Engineering, FAW and others.However, Madwara said the region could do even better by being bolder and taking steps into \"unchartered territory\".Looking forward, Madwara said in 2014 the business community in the Bay should start planning for the proposed oil refinery at Coega, Project Mthombo, as well as the booming energy economy and investments in the maritime, freight and logistics sectors.INFLUENTIAL GROUP: Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber president Mandla Madwara, chamber CEO Kevin Hustler, professor Derrick Swartz of NMMU and chamber deputy president Neil Hart at the annual chamber banquet which was held at the Boardwalk International Convention Centre last night PHOTOGRAPH: IVOR MARKMAN\n",

      "Historic Victorian terraced houses to become vibrant hub of creative activityWe are looking to retain its historic value with some modern flareAFTER years of neglect, a number of Victorian terraced houses in Donkin Street are getting a much needed facelift through a project which aims to see them become the creative hub of Port Elizabeth. It is envisaged that the 17 houses will soon be teeming with energy when they are reborn in the form of the Donkin Village Creative Quarter - a hub which will be home to photographers, architects and artists.The terrace contains 18 homes in total but one has been retained by its owner and will not form part of the project.The area has a long and rich history in the city, with the land first being divided in erf in 1854. Slowly houses were built, with the last one completed in the early 1880s. In 1967 they were proclaimed as national monuments.Over the years, the houses deteriorated and anti-social activities, like drug dealing and prostitution, became rife in the area.Perhaps the most controversial issue was the sale of 17 of the houses to property owner Ken Denton in 1999.The iconic row of houses continued to deteriorate until two and half years ago when Denton invested hundreds of thousands of rand in their refurbishment.The houses, still owned by Denton, should now be restored to their former glory by the end of the year.Project coordinator Tony James said: \"We are about 50% complete with the project and, should we work at full capacity for the rest of the year, it will be completed before Christmas. With help from my partner Allan Henderson we tried to keep each house as close to the original as possible, simply adding a few modern touches such as down lighting.\"Each unit is unique in terms of size and design so we found a common happy medium and went with it.\"We tried to keep the authenticity of each unit alive.\"The creative quarter is something which can be found in most major cities. \"We are looking to retain the areas historic value with some modern flare,\" James said.Of the 17 houses, four have already been leased out to modern design and creative companies Work at Play Photography and Design, Ampersand, Perfect Circle and DHK Architects.Ampersand publishes The Soapbox, a magazine aimed at exposing the Bay\\'s creative enterprises.The Soapbox creative director Reino Erasmus said: \"As a creative, I believe your immediate environment has a great influence over your work and thought process. But most importantly, your view on this world.\"By immersing yourself in such a historically significant and culturally vibrant part of town, you cannot help but to feel motivated to inspire others.\"The Soapbox operations director Greig Timkoe, agreed: \"Central and Govan Mbeki is the cultural coal face where Europe, Africa and Asia meet.\"I find the comparisons and similarities creatively stimulating, and it\\'s one of the chief reasons I choose to work here.\"Work at Play owner Karl Schoemaker said: \"We love the creative design concept. Being surrounded by other creative minds allows for a great work environment.\"It is [stimulating] for our type of industry, as opposed to our previous place where we were in a warehouse in Newton Park.\"WHERE THE ART IS: The Soapbox creative director Reino Erasmus, left, and operations director Greig Timkoe in front of their offices in the newly established Donkin Village Creative Quarter Picture: MIKE HOLMES\n",

      "THE tweet said: \"We are going to pass by Luthuli House now, just for control.\"It came from the official Economic Freedom Fighters\\' account as the EFF\\'s economic freedom march this week snaked along the former Sauer Street, which has been renamed Pixley ka Isaka Seme Street after the ANC founding father. It was a delicious irony that saw former ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema pass by the ruling party\\'s headquarters, with 40000 protesters in tow - an outcome that was hard to predict in 2011, when those same streets were lined with league members fighting the ANC\\'s disciplinary action against Malema.It gets better. \"We warn you. Stop listening to the ANC. In front of you here, you have a government in waiting,\" Malema said.The numbers brought out by the EFF were the most unsurprising feature of Tuesday\\'s march - Malema has always been a crowd-puller.It is clear the party\\'s message resonates. On a radical ticket, it obtained 6% of the vote in last year\\'s elections, with 10% of that coming from Gauteng.It was predicted the EFF would self-destruct before the next election. It is worth reflecting on what has happened in the 18 months since. First, the EFF is fashioned around a persona - the Malema and EFF brands are intertwined. Heading into elections last year, Malema was engulfed in legal battles. His run-in with the tax man and his corruption charges were the unspoken albatross around his neck and that of the party.Fast-forward to late 2015, both issues are distant memories and there is no clear and present threat to Malema\\'s grip on the party.In the short term, this is a strength, but in the long term, it poses a big threat. Second, the EFF made its appearance on the ballot paper last year with shaky, fledgling structures that have since been solidified through the holding of the party\\'s successful national conference at the end of last year and the launch of its student brigade, which is largely responsible for the continuation of student protests after the government conceded to a moratorium on fee hikes.While there was dissent at the national conference, this was not as debilitating an effect as with the Congress of the People. This was the second test the party had passed amid an array of fledgling parties since 1994.The EFF has also succeeded in keeping Nkandla on the national agenda, after Public Protector Thuli Madonsela put it there.So should the EFF be taken seriously?Absolutely, ignore the red tide at your peril.Its march on the JSE can be dismissed as a political stunt, as can its overall approach in parliament, but the party has those in charge listening. However, its keenest test is on the horizon: can it govern?It is unlikely it will win a metro in next year\\'s municipal elections, but the possibility of it winning a municipality looms large, and this is where its grit will truly be tested.Local government is the coal face of governance, minus the euphoria or sentiment attached to national elections.It is about political culture, ability and will to put the community first - it is where the governing party\\'s biggest failures lie after 21 years in the driving seat.Can the EFF, removed from its confusing ideological rhetoric, ensure water infrastructure, sanitation and roads are maintained? Can it collect the garbage on time? Can it be trusted with ratepayers\\' money? If the party is intrinsically linked to the identity of its leader, his track record in this regard is sorely lacking.If it is permitted to govern, the true colours of the EFF will emerge.\n",

Dlamini told union leaders most of them last saw the masses when they were elected. He made the remarks at the opening of Cosatu\\'s central executive committee meeting in Johannesburg on Monday. The meeting was attended by the leaders of its 22 affiliates.Dlamini said there was a dangerous increase in the exclusive focus on an individual at the expense of recognising the role of the masses.\"My observation is that there is a leadership stampede among us about who must come out as having led the popular masses to a socialist victory,\" he said.\"Within this context we undermine each other, sidestep each other, where possible drag each other down and claim our independence even at the expense of the very revolution we are pursuing.\"Cosatu was rattled by succession battles after its general secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi, announced that he would not stand for re-election next year.Vavi later said he had made his announcement too early and that Cosatu members would decide his future.Dlamini wanted to know if Cosatu would be able to handle the financial crisis currently happening internationally if they hit South Africa. He said it might be impossible since the leaders were not united in fighting for the masses.\"No organisation, let alone a revolution, can be effectively led by people who have no confidence in each other, no matter how intelligent and articulate they might be as individuals. No democratic organisation can go forward in its mission when its elected leadership gets undermined by the very people who elected them,\" he said.Dlamini told the union leaders that they were put in their positions to lead.\"Comrades, let\\'s do the most basic things first and one of those is to respect each other as leaders, confront each other without being vindictive, support each other and develop each other where we have weaknesses.He said the the masses that were at the coal face of the painful reality of poverty, inequality and unemployment were getting into action as happened in Egypt, US and in Europe recently.\n",

      "THE story of Moeketsi \"Keke\" Koalepe\\'s life is rooted in the struggle for land in Alexandra, Johannesburg.He was a fearless activist who epitomised the old values of service and commitment to the people. Koalepe was born on December 1 1936 in Kroonstad, Free State, and as a young man relocating to Dark City, as Alexandra was fondly called, he found himself thrust into the coal face of the Struggle.In 1956 he was arrested and sent to No 4 Gaol at the Johannesburg Fort, for not being in possession of a pass to work in the city. On the third day, as he was about to be sold to the potato farms in Bethal, his employer learnt of his fate and came to bail him out.As an activist he was caught up in the middle of the famous 1956 bus boycott.Koalepe joined the underground operational structures of the ANC in the early 1960s. He also worked closely with the media and was a freelance journalist in the mid-1970s.At the height of the Alexandra land expropriation, Koalepe was a member of the Save Alexandra Party campaign.In the late 1980s he became chairman of Alexandra Land and Property Owners Association (Alpoa).His life was threatened in the spring of 1989 at Nobuhle Hostel Hall in Alexandra during the launch of the notorious campaign called \"Phansi Ngo Mastende, Phezulu Ngo Mkhukhu a Blitz Krieg\" that saw property owners physically assaulted.During the political violence of the early 1990s Koalepe helped to find refuge and accommodation at various centres, unused schools and churches for the displaced.Koalepe was a highly regarded and outspoken member of the Alexandra Peace Committee and in 1992 became the delegate of Alpoa at a few gatherings.He was instrumental in the inception and development of Far East Bank in 1994 and River Park.Koalepe coordinated the ANC Veterans League and served as an advisory member during the initial land claims negotiations in the 1990s.At the dawn of democracy, Koalepe was a peace monitor in the township during the 1994 general elections.He propelled the return of Alpoa to the historic Old Health Committee Building where he spent his last days and strength to ensure the return of the apartheid- expropriated properties of the original people of Alexandra.He was the driving force behind the iconic court interdict by Alpoa to restore the land and ensure that justice prevailed.Koalepe was also a sports fanatic who participated in boxing and became a renowned tennis player who also trained youngsters in Alexandra.Known as elder Koalepe in church circles, he served the Uniting Reformed Church (URCSA) in Alexandra in different leadership positions as a church council member and chairperson of the finance committee working with late reverends Sam Buti and Beyers Naudé.He was also part of the church collective that advocated for the transformation and unification of the then NG Kerk. Koalepe will be remembered for his love for people and his humility.He is survived by his wife Caroline, three sons and three daughters, 10 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.He will be buried tomorrow at Waterfall Cemetery after a service at San Kopano Centre starting at 8am.ICON: Keke Koalepe\n",

Granted, as bureaucrats often argue, this is not necessarily wasted or stolen money.But it tells a compelling story of a culture in local government where rules are flouted, whether justifiably or for nefarious ends, thus creating fertile ground for corruption and looting.Makwetu\\'s report paints a numeric picture of the disaster and ineptitude that is our municipal systems.Just over a billion rand was spent on consultants, yet the majority of councils produced poor audits.None of this is surprising.It is simply the latest instalment of the horror story we have become used to over the years, one that is so evident in the breakdown of many of our towns and cities across the country.This is partly a crisis of capacity among municipal officials who are unable to perform some basic functions for which they are responsible.It is also a direct result of the patronage-driven cadre deployment politics that rule municipalities.It is further compounded by an entrenched culture of no accountability or consequences for rogue behavior by municipal leaders.Until now, this state of affairs has meant that many parts of our country have remained underdeveloped or, worse, what little they had has been eroded.The impact of this poor governance at the coal face of our communities will only be made worse by the arrival of Covid-19 to our shores.The devastation caused by this pandemic places an even greater burden on towns and cities, not only to function, but to build infrastructure and systems that will drive recovery on the ground.The most tragic thing is that by and large, we as communities often fail to choose the right people for the job.\n",

      "SOUTH Africa is to lose a voice of reason and reconciliation that has guided the country through turbulent times for the past 30 years. Yesterday Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu announced that he would be retiring from public life on October 7, on his 79th birthday. At a packed press conference the beloved church leader said the day he introducedNelson Mandelaas the country\\'s first democratically elected president, he thought: \"God, if I die now, I don\\'t really mind.\" This was the highlight of the Nobel Peace Prize winner\\'s career, which has spanned decades and which he has spent, according to him, contributing to the development of a \"new democratic, exhilarating, exasperating nation\". During a press conference at St George\\'s Cathedral in Cape Town\\'s city centre, Tutu joked and laughed as he explained his reasons for stepping out of the limelight. His infectious giggles kept journalists laughing, but at least one was overcome with emotion and had to blink away tears as Tutu spoke. Instead of being constantly on the move, he said he wanted to \"wind down\". \"I\\'ve always longed for more contemplating, for more quiet, to catch up on my reading. The time has now come to slow down, to sip rooibos tea with my beloved wife in the afternoons, to watch cricket, to travel to visit my children and grandchildren, rather than to conferences and conventions and university campuses,\" said Tutu. He said the \"best decision\" of his life had been getting married to Leah, his wife of 55 years. \"I pay tribute to my wife. Now I will have time to serve her hot tea in the mornings as any doting husband should.\" Asked if he had any regrets, Tutu chuckled. \"I still do have a tiny bit of me that wants to have been able to use a stethoscope. I hoped to become a physician. Each time I see those white coats, a little bit of me feels it. \"And maybe somebody might tell me what it is like to be tall.\" Tutu said he had \"crazy grandchildren\" who would keep him on his toes. He would possibly miss his hectic schedule and the attention he attracted, but did not think he would crave it. Although he had prostate cancer, he was \"as fine as I can hope to be\". \"I don\\'t propose to climb Table Mountain. I don\\'t intend to keel over at present.\" He retired as Anglican archbishop of Cape Town in 1996 and again when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which he chaired, wrapped up. Since then his schedule had \"grown increasingly punishing\". Tutu, who thanked his colleagues, doctors and all South Africans, said he would now limit his time in his office to one day a week until the end of February next year. He would honour existing diary appointments but none would be added to his schedule. He would continue supporting the Desmond Tutu Peace Centre in Cape Town and still be involved with the Elders, a group of global leaders, and the Nobel Laureate Group. He would step down as chancellor of the University of the Western Cape and as a member of the UN advisory committee on prevention of genocide. Glowing tributes followed the announcement yesterday. Retired Black Sash leader Mary Burton, who served with Tutu on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said: \"He was a wonderful champion and leader of the TRC. He is an inspiring leader of our society with prophetic vision of care for the poorest and the vulnerable. He does not hesitate to speak his mind on controversial issues.\" Western Cape Premier Helen Zille said Tutu had become an international icon of fearless integrity who took a stand throughout his long public life against the abuse of power. ANC spokesman Brian Sokutu said Tutu was at the coal face of the struggle against apartheid and stood out at a time few religious leaders wanted to associate themselves with the liberation struggle. \"True to his culture he never minced his words in supporting campaigns to end decades of apartheid rule. We wish him all the best. We shall miss his sense of humour even if he deals with serious issues,\" Sokutu said.\n",

      "LOCAL government as the sphere closest to citizens has an inherent responsibility to facilitate private sector involvement and encourage self-sustaining development within municipalities - and it is in this vein that the KwaZulu-Natal Local Government Association (Kwanaloga) has a key role to play. Durban mayor and Kwanaloga chairman Obed Mlaba said the constitution had clearly outlined the function of local government and provided a framework for its interaction across national and provincial government spheres and civil society organisations. \"The question is whether Kwanaloga can address the challenges affecting the province\\'s 61 municipalities, such as their lack of capacity and skills to deliver on the constitutional mandate, or the extent to which the national and provincial governments have been able to support municipalities,\" he said. In a nutshell, Kwanaloga\\'s role as a local government association ensures national and provincial governments correctly implement the constitution in dealing with municipalities. Through legislative and other measures, the organisation wants the spheres of government to support and strengthen municipal capacity. Consequently, all draft national or provincial legislation affecting the status, institution, powers or functions of local government must be shared with the South African Local Government Association (Salga) and/or Kwanaloga before being introduced to Parliament or provincial legislature. \"As the provincial organised local government, this allows Kwanaloga the opportunity to make representations on the draft legislation or policy on the municipalities\\' behalf,\" Kwanaloga CEO Sandile Cele said. However, poverty eradication, employment creation and growth stimulation were \"at the heart\" of local government\\'s mandate and had to find expression in the municipal integrated development plans (IDPs). Mlaba said Kwanaloga was \"acutely aware\" that municipalities were both at the coal face of service delivery and very close to the communities. That meant Kwanaloga had to develop members\\' capacity; provide a tailor-made training programme that equipped councillors with the skills and knowledge to competently carry out their duties. However, Cele said most KwaZulu-Natal municipalities were rural, with a large percentage of their communities living in abject poverty. \"Complicating matters, rural municipalities with their poor inhabitants are more exposed to the threat posed by climate change,\" he said. Earlier this year, Kwanaloga in partnership with the Agriculture and Rural Development Department hosted a Climate Change |and Rural Development Summit. Mlaba said the initiative was a platform for municipalities, critical stakeholders and government departments to refocus thinking towards tabling policies appropriate to dealing with climate change issues. Cele said the organisation was keen for municipalities to play their part in KwaZulu-Natal\\'s agricultural development, adding that the province required innovative approaches to succeed in agrarian reform.\n",

      "In a fundamental sense, there is a right route for a nation to take - away from the glorification of rulers towards respect for the ruled. You want a society where your minister of education sends his children to public schools, your minister of health uses public hospitals, your leaders in government live among their people, not above them. Most societies come from a time when rulers occupied a \"mezzanine floor\" as demigods. Most take the right route, though not always rapidly. South Africa appears to have gone the opposite way. The latest manifestation is that police protection of big shots has been extended to provincial commissioners of police. On Friday we reported that a police senior management forum had decided that our provincial commissioners would get bodyguards. This followed a robbery at the home of Gauteng\\'s police commissioner, Mzwandile Petros, while his wife was present. The gang has apparently been terrorising ordinary citizens in the neighbourhood. We were told the security for our police chiefs would be provided after a risk assessment for each commissioner, with the Gauteng and KZN commissioners first in line for protection, given that they are regarded to be working and living in the two most dangerous provinces. Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa has justified the decision by saying that provincial commissioners should be provided with security because of the work that they do. \"They are king when it comes to fighting crime and they might have created enemies. Their safety should be prioritised in their provinces.\" Something doesn\\'t seem right with the logic. We have reports of under-resourced police stations and police officers at the coal face of the fight against crime. We have the all-too-familiar death toll of police killed in action while doing their jobs to serve and protect. And then there\\'s the irony that the officers responsible for protecting us (the ones who pay them) are to have more resources devoted to protecting themselves from their own failures. The route is wrong.\n",

      "The request by members of SAPS management for bodyguard protection is yet another manifestation of the obsession with self, and disregard for the well-being of lesser mortals, shown by government functionaries (The Mercury, August 19). Those in management positions, unlike rank |and file members who |risk their lives hunting |down dangerous criminals, are not at the coal face |of fighting crime A burglary at the home of the Gauteng commissioner cannot be used to justify protection. Why should members of police management not pay for armed response services themselves, as many citizens do? According to the South African Institute of Race Relations, the number of protection and security services personnel in the police has already increased 20 and 10 times faster, respectively, than the numbers of detectives and visible policing members. This in itself is unfair on taxpayers, and on ordinary police members. It is not as if many members of SAPS management do their jobs properly. If they did, they would respond to letters, and there would not be so much corruption, ill-discipline and unbridled brutality. Members who excel at their work would be acknowledged and not sidelined. Working conditions and being bypassed for promotion at the expense of those less competent and experienced contribute to hard-working members\\' stress. Proceedings at the recent summit on police killings in Durban illustrate the disdain with which government representatives hold their constituencies. It started almost two hours late, wasting the time of those attending, including station commissioners who had travelled from all over the province. Do they not realise how disrespectful their conduct is? A string of speeches followed, leaving little time for the group discussions which were supposed to produce useful input about reducing police killings. To add insult to injury, the group I attended wasted more time with a silly game - at which stage I left. As in other government departments, those responsible for policing waste time and money in meetings and talk shops, when they should be dealing with endemic problems in their ranks through proper management and disciplinary procedures.

      "Albert van Jaarsveld has been named as the new vice-chancellor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). The appointment of the head of the National Research Foundation (NRF) will delight many of the staff and students, after he emerged as the favourite in the race for the top job. As of February 1, Van Jaarsveld will lead more than 40 000 students and 5 000 employees when he succeeds Professor Malegapuru Makgoba. Van Jaarsveld, who has a PhD in |zoology, has spent part of his career in academic and management positions at the University of Pretoria and the University of Stellenbosch. In an interview with The Mercury yesterday, the chairwoman of the university council, Phumla Mnganga, said that Van Jaarsveld\\'s credentials as a scholar, his knowledge of the South African research system, and his track record as a chief executive, had counted in his favour. Van Jaarsveld had come across as innovative, a good listener and as having a \"genuine commitment\" to the university twin imperatives of academic excellence and transformation. In a statement, Van Jaarsveld said: \"I have been presented with an invaluable opportunity to return to academia in a capacity that will bring me closer to the coal face of skills development and scientific research in South Africa. \"I feel that I can make an important contribution to UKZN in its efforts to further grow its teaching stature, improve its research capacity, to contribute to institutional transformation and to enhance the international standing of UKZN as a major research-driven higher education institution.\" Mnganga told The Mercury the senior appointments committee, on which she served, had been proud that the shortlist of three had included two internal candidates, professors Renuka Vithal and John Mubangizi. The search for a new vice-chancellor had been \"exciting and challenging\". The recruitment process had included collecting verbal and written submissions from the university\\'s internal and external stakeholders on what they were looking for in a new leader. \"There was an overriding consensus regarding what people wanted as a cluster of competencies for their leader. \"Firstly, they wanted a scholar of international standing. They wanted an individual who would command respect among other academics, locally and internationally.\" Stakeholders, from students to donors, also wanted a \"strong\" leader with a solid management track record, who would build a sense of cohesion among a university community spread across five different campuses, and which had come together as the result of a merger. \"Lastly, there was emphasis on a person who would continue on the university\\'s twin trajectories of academic excellence and transformation,\" |Mnganga explained. \"Transformation cuts across the entire fabric of this institution. Transformation is not just in our student numbers, it\\'s in the knowledge production project. And when you\\'ve achieved that critical mass, as an institution, you can be truly non-racial. We are at a point where we can proudly go and look for a talented and capable person... It doesn\\'t mean the transformation agenda stops, it continues,\" Mnganga said when asked whether Van Jaarsveld\\'s appointment would not come as a surprise to many. Van Jaarsveld has been chief executive of the National Research Foundation since 2009. Under him, the budget of the foundation doubled to R4 billion, and the number of NRF-rated researchers increased by 56 percent. The number of NRF-rated researchers who were black grew by 55 percent, and the number of NRF-rated researchers who were women by 36 percent. Since 2009, the global research citation impact of South African science has also swelled by 25 percent. Speaking after his successor was announced, Makgoba said the university had bought into non-racialism as an |institution, and that it did not \"only focus on women and blacks\". Student Representative Council president Sithabiso Mthethwa said that all three candidates had been capable, and that as an institution of higher learning the university was \"beyond race and gender\". Both Mthethwa and the president of convocation, Fanle Sibisi, pledged their commitment to working with the new vice-chancellor. \"I\\'m convinced that he will take us to greater heights, provided he is supported,\" Sibisi said. Makgoba would not entertain questions on his 10 years at the helm of theuniversity, or on what his future held. But the last decade has not been without controversy, with accusations of the stifling of academic freedom, and several staffers complaining of low morale as the result of a poor relationship with management. Last month, when Van Jaarsveld presented his leadership vision to the university community, he said the staff were its most valuable strategic asset and that the culture of service should be student orientated.\n",

      "I was recently at a meeting at which we were discussing incentives to attract investment to our province. Organised business made the point that we needed to be careful when doing so, to ensure that we do not inadvertently create uneven playing fields for those businesses that have already invested in our province. If we offer rates holidays and services relief to new investors who offer products and services in competition with existing businesses, then the new investors will obviously enjoy an unfair competitive advantage in the market place, and what may in fact occur is that you will achieve employment in the new businesses and retrenchment in the existing businesses, resulting in no economic development and no net increase in jobs. If you offer an incentive to a new business, existing competitors should enjoy similar benefits. The other point under discussion at the meeting was the current political instability. Firstly, I must say that I was disappointed to hear a senior economic development official trying to deny the existence of any political instability. Perhaps he doesn\\'t watch the news? Anyway, denialism aside, the political instability is constraining for business. It makes South Africa unattractive from an investment perspective (who wants to build factories in places where there is a real risk that they\\'ll be burnt down) and risky from a trade point of view. I was recently contacted by one of my members, who explained that they were battling to order a machine from a supplier overseas, who they had been dealing with for many years. They normally order the machine and have to make payments in tranches, as the machine is built. The supplier, however, citing political instability and uncertainty in the country, is now requesting guarantees from the bank for the entire cost of the commissioned machine. My member, a medium-sized engineering firm, explained that if the bank were to provide the requested guarantees, then 80% of his overdraft facility would be unavailable for the next five months, the time that it would take to build the machine. He is unable to operate his business under these conditions. My point is that while it might be more convenient to deny issues such as political instability, we do so at our own peril. Business also raised the fact that our current economic circumstances mean that a large number of existing businesses are in serious trouble and that it would make sense to be proactive and to put a retention strategy in place. The MEC for Economic Development agreed, and to his credit, very soon after that meeting, a request came from Trade Investment KwaZulu-Natal (TIKZN) for a list of businesses currently in distress. I put the call out to my members and the responses came in, one after another. How sad it made me feel to receive those phone calls and e-mails. If you think generally about the fact that economic conditions are challenging, it doesn\\'t hit home quite as hard as when you have leaders, that you know and respect, explaining their current business realities or when you see big factories going into liquidation. Leadership, we\\'re at the coal face and it\\'s not pretty. We\\'re in trouble and we need you to stand up. American writer and political commentator Walter Lippmann said: \"A man has honour if he holds himself to an ideal of conduct though it is inconvenient, unprofitable, or dangerous to do so.\" We need you to stabilise things. l The chief executive of the Pietermaritzburg Chamber of Commerce, Veness can be reached at 033 3452747 orceo@pcb.org.za\n",

      "WHEN civil engineering manager Yasmin Sheriff first started out as a consultant for Sapref she would sit quietly in the corner afraid to say boo to a goose. Today, she doesn\\'t stand down for anyone. \"For 8 years I was a contractor here, trying to get a foot in the door. But my mother always taught me: \\'If you feel there is a barrier in front of you, don\\'t give up until you have found a way to get over it,\" she said. While the feisty mother of three may describe herself as tough to work for, and not prepared to show weakness, pushing her staff towards growth opportunities was her ongoing goal. \"If I need to cry, then I will go to my office or the toilet and shut the door and have a good cry. I won\\'t show weakness. I am tough, I am fair, but those who report to me know that all I want is for them to grab every opportunity and go for it,\" she said. Sheriff is just one of the remarkable women at Durban\\'s Sapref refinery who are making an indelible mark in the heavy manufacturing sector. Similarly, tankage engineer Sam Stephenson said she had learnt to voice her opinion in a firm and confident way to make sure, even as a woman in an industry previously dominated by men, she was respected and heard. \"I am the only woman in my department. I have such respect for all my colleagues. The women here inspire me with their stories. I just love the challenge of what I do,\" she said. Charity Mkhize, who was the first woman at the refinery to become a team leader, said women usually had to work harder to earn respect. \"Some people don\\'t respect women. We have to work harder to show our fellow employees and seniors that we know what we are doing,\" she said. Thobeka Masondo, a berth manager at Island View, who was also the first woman in the job of overseeing the docking and offloading of fuel tankers, said that while the position was overwhelming, her 12 years\\' experience and training at Sapref had her adapting in no time. \"I am the first woman to be in this position. So yes, it was daunting. What we do is to make sure that South Africa has fuel and that it comes into the country safely. My job, I guess, keeps the economy turning. I work really hard and that earns me respect,\" she said. Nicky Captain, a senior process technician in charge of the massive \"motherboard\" that controls the mixing of the various refined products, said she liked working with men because they were easy communicators. She said her job, which she loved, meant she was at the coal face of the daily operation. \"The fact that my job is hands-on and I am in constant communication with others - I wouldn\\'t want to do anything else.\" A story of sheer guts after her parents died during her matric year, Noluthano Khumalo, 28, is studying chemical engineering at the Mangosuthu University of Technology during the day, working night shifts at Sapref as an apprentice operator and supporting her three siblings who are also studying. \"There is a starting point for everything,\" she said when asked what her message to other young women facing similar challenges would be. \"Sometimes you have to start doing something else first. I wanted to be a technologist. But it\\'s okay. What I am doing now will contribute to my experience. At the moment I am hands-on, checking that the operations here at the refinery run smoothly, but in five years\\' time I won\\'t be outside any more. I will be inside these offices following my dream. I will be a technologist, in a senior position.\" Also determined not to give up, Silungile Zaca, 31, spent years trying to get accepted into the training programme at Sapref. She started out as a mechanical apprentice at Sapref six months ago. \"I come from a Umbumbulu. It\\'s a deep rural area. You have to walk a long way before you can even think of finding transport.

I have tried in my almost 70 years on earth to judge people as individuals regardless of race, religion, sex or sexual orientation. It is, most of the time, a liberating and enlightening way to interact with my fellow humans. Tired generalisations such as what \"white people say or black people do\", fall away and I see two things - we are not as different as we often think we are and relations between people on a personal level are much better in South Africa than as often portrayed in the press, and especially in the dangerous social media. I am tired of reading about how \"white people\" are unrepentant bigots or \"white capitalists\" are the root of all evil. Whilst the wrongs of the past and racism in all its forms must be addressed, writers like Essa and your other regular, Justin Fox, need to dwell less on academic pontifications and more on the crisis at the coal face, where millions of South Africans still live in dire poverty - not because of white racism but through the failure of our current administration to govern the country properly. In 1994, although not a formal supporter, I viewed the ANC of our late lamented president Mandela as the right party to transform this country and correct the wrongs of the past.

      "AS A CHILD, Major-General Bala Naidoo admired police officers who looked resplendent in their uniforms and drove shiny cars. This is what he wanted to do and the calling was strong. He left school in Standard eight (Grade 6) and at 17 years old tried to enrol in the police force. The recruiting officer took one look at the scrawny teenager who weighed 52kg and decided he didn\\'t have what it would take to maintain law and order. Naidoo worked on a sugar cane plantation, among other jobs, but he could not resist the calling. Eventually, he entered the force, becoming a constable in the Railway Police unit whose task it was to patrol railway yards and Durban harbour. This was the beginning of a remarkable career that has spanned 41 years and has seen the once bright-eyed and young constable become a major-general in the provincial SAPS. On December 31, Naidoo hangs up his hat, having spent two-thirds of his life pursuing the calling that has defined his existence. As he prepares to leave, throngs of visitors line up at his office at the KZN police headquarters on Ordnance Road to wish him well. Remarkably, for someone who has spent four decades in the force, Naidoo has fired his weapon only once - a warning shot into the air to persuade a suspect to stop running away. Of all the anecdotes Naidoo has to share about his career, this one best describes the veteran cop who colleagues describe as tenacious, diplomatic and one of the hardest workers they have ever known. \"When I started I was 18 years and 3 months old. In those days police were very much respected. I was the only policeman in my community and if you worked in government it was seen as an achievement. People would come to me when they saw me walking on the street and they would ask me for my help.\" In 1986, the Railway Police merged with the general police force and the following year Naidoo faced a dilemma as he had been requested to transfer to head up the stock theft unit in De Aar, Northern Cape. Orders were orders but Naidoo was reluctant to leave KwaZulu-Natal. \"I saw a position advertised in the police communications department. I was fluent in English and Afrikaans, and my Zulu was good so I applied.\" And the rest is history - Naidoo has worked in police communications since 1987. The role would put him at the coal face with the media and the public. During the nineties and early 2000s, Naidoo became a household name. In 2007, then National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi requested that Naidoo take up the post of station commissioner of the Durban Central police station. The station was the biggest in the province in terms of resources and the population its officers served. It was the third-largest in the country. But the station was in a mess. Too many officers were on sick leave, the public was outraged by the inefficient call response times and the apathy shown by police. \"There was a lack of control at the biggest police station in the province. Forty-three officers were booked off sick for an indefinite period of time, there was no follow-up to complaints and the community served by this station was frustrated at the inefficiency that was taking place.\" Undeterred, Naidoo surrounded himself with a strong team of senior police officers and set to work. He could have gone in with a heavy hand, but this is not his style. \"We needed to understand why so many police officers were booked off sick. My approach was to understand the problems - family issues, problems with a specific commander or other job-related conditions. In the end, we found that only four officers were really sick and the rest we were able to get back on duty. \"I believe that if you respect everyone - from the highest to the lowest-ranking officer - you can get co-operation. Everyone has a role to fulfil in the organisation and you must understand the human being to obtain co-operation. Sometimes, you have to be decisive or harsh and sometimes you have to be diplomatic.\" Naidoo believes it is important for a police officer to also be a humanist. At Durban Central he found that shoplifters with infants were being placed in cells with 600 people. \"There was opposition when I suggested that they be given a warning to appear in court and released, but children should never be kept in the cells because their parents have committed an offence. \"Sometimes, if it was late at night, a police car would take the mothers and their children home. If you have a human touch you can still be a police officer. It is important to have this balance.\" The 1990s saw the unbanning of the ANC and some of the worst incidents of inter-party violence the province has ever seen. Naidoo was at the forefront of communications. \"Violence monitors and political parties were looking for a scapegoat and they found one in the form of the police. They accused us of turning a blind eye to the Inkatha/ANC violence or, on some occasions, of being part of the killings. \"Instead of reacting negatively to the criticism, we started to work closely with the parties and they started to trust us.\" As his last wish, Naidoo said he wants to see the role of the SAPS changing from a job to a profession. \"If I had to go back to when I was deciding on a career, I would definitely choose this career again.\" Naidoo is looking forward to his retirement and will now pour his energy into the KZN Tamil Federation - an organisation he has had links with for decades. \"As I prepare to leave, I know there are many, many people in the SAPS who will continue to serve this organisation with dedication and take this country forward.\" Chetty is Independent Media\\'s regional political editor\n",

      "The Sharks were one of the South African teams tipped to be a dark horse for the Super Rugby title this year, but after six rounds they are fighting a rearguard action, and they still have the Blues in Auckland and the Hurricanes in Wellington ahead of them. Let us not bluff ourselves, it is going to take something Herculean for the Sharks to beat these two New Zealand teams, starting with the Blues on Saturday, and then when they return to Durban, they immediately face the Bulls and Stormers in a fortnight of a derbies at King\\'s Park. If you are a Sharks fan, your loyalty might be tested to the utmost over the next month. The fact is the Sharks need some players to step up and become heroes because right now nobody is doing the job, particularly up front. In fact, I would say the backline is just about blameless in terms of attack. They are not getting the possession to ignite this highly talented backline. If this Sharks backline can run on to the ball at pace, the possibilities are exciting. Outside centre Lukhanyo Am, the interchangeable back three of Lwazi Mvovo, Makazole Mapimpi, Sbu Nkosi, Curwin Bosch and Kobus van Wyk can, and will, score tries if they get quality possession. The Sharks\\' loose forwards are not entirely at fault, and it would seem the problem is that the Sharks do not have a tight five that is capable of taking the fight to the opposition. There seems to be a lack of strong leadership across the board at the coal face up front. I am not singling out Ruan Rotha as a poor captain or lock, not at all, but as a unit the tight five are not imposing themselves. They have got to take the game to the enemy, get stuck in and allow the loose forwards to have a better shot at winning the rucks. I don\\'t see that happening at the moment. One wonders if leaving an experienced leader in Keegan Daniel at home was a wise move. It would seem the Sharks have a leadership problem in the pack, and somebody has to step up on Saturday and for the rest of the tour. Stephan Lewies is one such player, and The Beast must take a leading role. Akker van der Merwe came to the Sharks from the Lions as a much-hyped player, and he will be the starting hooker now that Franco Marais has announced that he is leaving the Sharks for Gloucester after this competition. Let\\'s see the formidable Akker do his thing. Jean-luc du Preez is another who must step us as a leader. The Sharks\\' pack is competitive, but it is not attacking opposition packs. Think of the days of Mark Andrews and Steve Atherton smashing the living daylights out of the opposition. The Sharks pack needs to get some serious fire in their bellies and as a unit take on the opposition. There is no better place than New Zealand for players to forge their reputations. The Sharks\\' forwards have to step up at Eden Park on Saturday. There is just too much talent at the back going under-utilised. This match against the Blues is the Sharks\\' third on tour. It is often the third week when the minds of the players begin to wander on a month-long tour. But for the Sharks it is the week when the players need to stand up and be counted, and just maybe a few new heroes will be unearthed.\n",

This annual celebration looks to highlight the important role nurses play in society and marks the anniversary of Florence Nightingale\\'s birth,\" it said. The International Council of Nurses (ICN) led the celebrations and this year\\'s theme was \"Nursing: the balance of mind, body, and spirit.\" \"Hospersa embraces this theme and commends nurses for being the lifeblood of the healthcare system where many challenges beyond their control continue to paralyse it,\" Hospersa spokesperson Kevin Halama said. \"However, poor working conditions, especially in public health facilities, continue to be a thorn in the flesh in the delivery of quality healthcare,\" he said. Leaking ceilings, broken lifts and depleted buildings had become the face of public healthcare. A number of hospitals and clinics had been in violation of occupational health and safety standards (OHS), yet the health department was moving at a snail\\'s pace in addressing the reported OHS contraventions, Halama said. \"There is also a high prevalence of workplace infections of tuberculosis (TB), which is robbing the health sector of a skilled workforce that consists of predominantly nurses.\" It was high time that TB prevention among health workers, especially nurses, took priority, as they were at the coal face of both the HIV and TB epidemics, Halama said. \"Furthermore, the staff morale of nurses is very low due to meagre salaries, poor implementation of the nurses\\' uniform allowance, and non-translation of nurses who qualified to progress into higher positions, for example, enrolled nursing assistants to enrolled nurses and enrolled nurses to professional nurses. \"In the private sector, employers continue implementing less than favourable salary increases in an economic environment characterised by a weaker rand and rising costs which have diminished nurses\\' earnings,\" he added. Ncumisa Mafunda, spokesperson for the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health said nurses are the \"backbone\" of the health sector. \"Regarding the issues raised, the department has always had open channels for engagement with organised labour where all relevant issues are discussed,\" she said. Mafunda added that the department was committed to improving the overall working conditions of staff including their safety within available limited resources. \"The department wishes all nurses well on International Nurses\\' Day and beyond, and acknowledges the critical role that they play in the healthcare value chain,\" she said. Halama said: \"We now call on the Department of Health and private sector employers to follow our lead in improving the working conditions of nurses. \"Hospersa will continue campaigning for an improved healthcare system that not only addresses the delivery of quality healthcare to communities but also looks at improving the lives of the many nurses that are at the forefront of the country\\'s healthcare system.\" | Karen Singh African News Agency (ANA)\n",

      "A month ago I had an enjoyable interview with All Black great Justin Marshall when he and Bryan Habana were on a media jaunt deep in the Eastern Cape bush. Marshall told me that while the rest of the rugby world had closed the gap on the All Blacks, the reason he believes they will prevail in Japan is because they have senior players who best know how to play the big points in the big games. \"Will (they) go into their shells because of the pressure of the World Cup or continue to play the attacking game that has seen them close the gap on New Zealand since the 2015 World Cup?\" Marshall queried. \"I think the answer to this question of how to play at a World Cup comes down to leadership - in terms of making the right choices in game situations... When to keep it tight and when to cut loose.\" And leadership is where the All Blacks are probably better endowed than their rivals - they have a host of players going into their third World Cup. As Marshall puts it: \"The All Blacks have a spine of players who have been to the World Cup coal face before and are not going to be daunted about being there in the big games. (All Black captain) Kieran Read will instinctively know when to take three points or kick to the corner because he has been there before. \"A big problem for the rest of the world is that for 12 years, only the All Blacks have got to a final and won it. That is a long time.\" Fair enough Marshall, but by your own admission the top-six teams in World Rugby can go toe to toe with the All Blacks in 2019 whereas in 2015 the gap between the world champions and the rest was a joke. \"You see, what the All Blacks have been good at over the years under Steve Hansen was winning the shi*** games,\" Marshall admitted. \"When they had a bad day they still found a way to win.\" Now when they are having a bad day they are either drawing or losing or even copping 47 points (against the Wallabies in a Bledisloe Cup game), which is unheard of. \"When you (are) not playing well but still winning you are on edge and continually reviewing the way you are playing... you are asking questions. At the end of those games you have ultimately got the answers because you have won, so it is a case of \\'let\\'s just get better at winning.\\' But now they have to think \\'if we are losing or drawing, what has gone wrong,\" Marshall said. Well exactly... This is a slight problem for the All Blacks. They can\\'t be having off days in big games at the World Cup. If they do, it could result in something along the lines of Wallabies scrumhalf George Gregan famously reminding Marshall at the end of the 2003 semi-final in Australia that there would be \"four more years of pain, Justin, four more years!\" From a South African point of view, here\\'s hoping!\n",

The AEMFC\\'s current portfolio included coal, uranium, and limestone, which constituted strategic mineral resources.

The air is earthy and thick with moisture, making you even more aware of the metres of heavy soil above you. At its narrowest point, the chute is only 18cm across. A thick, cotton workman’s suit hangs heavily on your frame, but you have to be covered so that the jutting rocks do not pierce and scrape skin. You take a deep breath, trying to get oxygen out of the saturated air, and prepare to go down. Read more: Scientists bag more than 1 000 fossils at Cradle \\'treasure trove\\'â€‹ This is what six scientists have been experiencing daily as they risk their lives to gather fossils from an underground cave in the Cradle of Humankind. For three weeks, these women have been working shifts of between four and seven hours painstakingly dusting and removing hominid and other animal bones from what has been described as the richest fossil site in South Africa. The Rising Star Expedition, the catchy name given to the excursion, is a collaboration between Wits University and National Geographic. \"Archaeology has a reputation as being an old boys club,\" says Becca Peixotto, one of the caving scientists. \"But the generation of scientists before me and my generation are changing the landscape.\" Mastermind of the expedition, Professor Lee Berger, says that these women are an inspiration for all scientists, and particularly young female scientists. \"Too often, women … doing this type of science think they are largely going to end up in a lab, doing lab work. [These] women are quite literally risking their lives at the front end of a scientific expedition.\" Multiple hominidsOn Tuesday, the last day of the Rising Star Expedition, Peixotto is manning the control centre, watching her colleagues via underground cameras. The centre – a green canvas tent containing screens, computers and telephones – is never unmanned while someone is in the cave, which is 30m underground. Australian Elen Feuerriegel is in the fossil chamber, lying on her side, a head torch lighting the area she is gently brushing to unearth what looks like a leg or arm bone. A 3D mapping programme will mark where in the dig site – which is actually less than two square metres – the fossil was found and automatically tag it. Berger refuses to comment on how many hominids are at the site, their species or age. He told the Mail & Guardian that the team had found more than one skull of an early hominid. \"We have partial skulls that are coming out … [from] multiple individuals,\" he says. The specimens are taken from the excavation site to the science tent, where they are catalogued and the automatic tag verified.Then they are bagged, boxed and added to the other thousand specimens that have been found on the site. Berger jokes that the Rising Star Expedition has bought out all the boxes in that area of Gauteng. Site a \\'treasure trove\\'Even though the team has pulled out, Berger says, \"We don\\'t have anywhere near [all of the fossils]. We haven\\'t scratched the surface. This excavation will go on for decades.\" The expedition was initially begun to recover a single skeleton, not a \"treasure trove\". We need to re-assess the scientific plan and also how to deal with the abundance of material … We are excavating [only] the most exposed fossils.\" Irrespective of what hominids are uncovered, the expedition itself is remarkable: an all-women team at the coal face of archaeological dig, which includes spelunking down into a cave deep under ground, and which was organised and completed in a number of weeks. Berger says he first found out about the fossils on October 1, and then mobilised funding and a very specific team (scientists who had caving experience and could fit through the tiny cave entrance) for an expedition which began on November 10. Three weeks later, they have specimens of some of the most sought after fossils – hominids. Part of the rush was that the fossils were \"vulnerably exposed\", Berger says. While he initially made mention of the summer rains in Gauteng forcing his hand, it would appear that was not the only concern: \"Someone had been there before, there was some damage.\" \\'Backyard syndrome\\'The National Geographic’s Andrew Howley refused to give details of the exact topography of the cave – saying only that \"there are tunnels, a climb and a chute\" and then the excavation site – because the area had been used for recreational caving, and he did not want to give away its location. People had been there without knowing the \"treasure trove\" they had been standing on. In fact, Berger says that there is a Barefoot Policy, and all cavers have to take their shoes off so that they can feel when fossils are underfoot and avoid them. Another layer to this tale is that archaeologists have been in that area, looking for fossils, since 1947, Berger says. The site is about 15km from Malapa (where Berger found Australopithicus sediba fossils in 2008); 1km from Sterkfontein (where Mrs Ples, an Australopithicus africanus, was found) and 600m from Swartkrantz (where there is the oldest evidence of humans using fire). \"[These fossils] were truly under our noses … It’s \\'backyard syndrome\\': we think we know what’s there, but we don’t.\" But even though there are still fossils at the site, which does not yet have a name, the team needs to pull out to regroup. \"We are shutting the doors behind us,\" says Berger, joking that some people say he should build a snake pit or a rolling boulder, like the one in the Indiana Jones movie, to keep unwanted people out. The area will be protected, he says. Pooling knowledgeThe major task now is analysis. When Berger discovered Australopithicus sediba in 2008, \"there were 250 elements [that] took thousands of man hours to [limn]\". But this expedition has yielded thousands. John Hawks, associate professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin, who is also working on the expedition, says that if the team was to analyse the data in the \"traditional way\", which involved groups keeping the data to themselves and analysing it using their data sets only, \"it would take more people than there are in the field\". Berger believes that the only way to analyse all the data is to go open source, and pool global resources. \"We\\'re going to explore the concept of developing a new way of sharing data.\" Also, South African postgraduates and emerging researchers will get a chance that most seasoned paleo scientists only dream of: to work on the primary analysis of what might be the largest single fossil find in South Africa.\n",

      "As Allister Coetzee is discovering, coaching a South African national side is like teaching a huge kindergarten class. But happier days might await. Who knows what Allister Coetzee has been telling the Boks in his team talks this week. But he could do worse than sing them the chorus of the John Legend ballad, Ordinary People. \"We\\'re just ordinary people/ We don\\'t know which way to go/ We\\'re just ordinary people/ Maybe we should take it sloooow.\" If he were to croon those tender lyrics to his charges (ideally with lots of vibrato), it goes without saying that they should not take the advice literally. Against Wales, the Boks must take it physically fast but philosophically slow. Because in these moments of South African sporting hysteria, when armies of slack-bellied armchair experts are howling and shaking their fists like so many man-sized toddlers, a national squad can easily lose sight of their fallible and irreducible humanity. The athletes in question, be they Boks or Bafana or Proteas, can instead start to feel like scandalously defective consumer products: like a consignment of glitchy robots, or a recalled batch of spontaneously combusting sex toys. To borrow the words of our dear president this week, spoken in reference to some annoyingly rule-bound banks, the players stand accused of \"putting our national image into some problems\". As though the fact of the Boks\\' loss to Italy is of any consequence to anyone except some South Africans and some Italians. But the craziest judginess is reserved for the coaches. This week, Coetzee has found himself compared with Proteas coach Russell Domingo, whose stock is soaring on the mint-flavoured majesty of his side\\'s victories Down Under. Such comparisons are generally odious - but not quite as odious as the midweek Twitter brainfart by former Bulls and Bok flyhalf Derick Hougaard (that legendary exponent of progressive, dynamic, ball-in-hand rugby), who opined that Coetzee\\'s miserable run is the fruit of transformation policies. Hougaard seems not to have noticed that the most melanin-rich Proteas team to date are on the brink of securing South Africa\\'s greatest Test series result ever. Domingo\\'s comeback is a credit to his savvy and endurance, but the factors behind the Proteas\\' current swagger extend well beyond any coach\\'s contribution. Great national sports teams are always made by an intricate equation between the structural and individual, the past and the present - but structures and histories typically boss those equations. So until South African rugby reinvents itself at a granular scale (a spectacularly difficult project in any given society, let alone our profoundly dysfunctional one), the Boks will always bow before the All Blacks, barring those sweet and rare seasons when the All Blacks are psycho-spiritually punished by the Maori gods for being such smug bastards and inexplicably lose their shit. And, unless South African football is reimagined and restaffed at every level, Bafana will never reach the second round of a World Cup finals - no matter which snazzy-suited foreign genius is hired to scream \"keepa your shape!\" on the touchline while making sensual squeezing gestures with his cupped palms. Which brings us to the woes of another national team custodian, the heroically cantankerous Shakes Mashaba. He has not kept his shape. Mashaba is set to face a disciplinary hearing next Thursday, when the South African Football Association\\'s (Safa\\'s) mandarins will seek to use his recent hissy fit aimed at them as an excuse to terminate his contract. Some would argue that the promising result against Senegal in the opening World Cup qualifier should justify giving him a chance to continue the campaign - but we have seen enough of Mashaba and his anti-preparation philosophy to know that he is more likely to guide his charges to Mars than to Russia. Unlike Coetzee, Mashaba has had his chance to prove his capacity to adapt. If Safa do ditch the grumpy grandpa, then they would do well to reappoint Pitso Mosimane in his place - provided they can convince the conqueror of Africa to take the gig. In a recent interview, the Sundowns coach claimed that he had no reason to return to international football, on the dubious grounds that the Confederation of African Football\\'s Champions League is comparable to the Africa Nations Cup, and the upcoming Club World Cup is comparable to the World Cup. This was vintage Pitso - making a fairly valid point in an annoying way. Of course, he has every right to prefer his Downs gig, which is less boring than the Bafana job, much less stressful, and possibly even better paid. The problem is that Safa cannot afford the kind of blue-chip foreign coach who could conceivably make a difference to the team - and no other South African coach can rival Pitso\\'s record or force of character. He\\'s notoriously arrogant - but for good reason, because he\\'s often right, having learnt his trade at length at the very different coal faces of domestic, international and African club football. A case in point was his postmortem on the night his Downs side were comprehensively schooled by Bidvest Wits in the MTN8 final, in early October. Mosimane tried to be gracious but failed beautifully. \"Sometimes everything happens for a reason. Maybe we win tonight and don\\'t win the Champions League. I will swap that because the MTN8 will come back again every year. The other one comes once in a while. It takes many years to go for it.\" And then he bloody went and won the Champions League, the so-and-so. He was right. But, even if he had been wrong, if he had lost in Cairo, he deserves our respect for having the gonads to speak boldly and honestly and face the consequences. The grown-up sports fans of this land can all accept the limitations of our various talent pools and the cyclical nature of form and team development. But we do always expect a bit of a show, or at least a proper attempt at a show. We want our teams to take risks, to reveal pleasure in their work, to honour our attention and loyalty. And the coaches need to be the soul of that performative project. Their duty is to honour the communal meaning of their task - not to win everything. Because the biggest secret of successful leadership is that you shouldn\\'t even bother. It\\'s a losing game from the get-go. That\\'s why those lumo-teethed \"business gurus\" savvily choose to write bollocksy bestsellers about management instead of managing people themselves. To herd groups of Homo sapiens toward a common goal is to fail, sooner or later, in one way or another, no matter how good you are. Ask United States President Barack Obama, who strove bravely and fruitlessly for eight years to treat the country\\'s various sicknesses. Now, like vengeful superbugs, the sicknesses are back, stronger than he found them. But he did lead. All we can ask of leaders, and national sports coaches, is to strive in style, with grace and wit and guts and honesty. At the very least, Coetzee deserves the time to demonstrate that - like all of us - he and his players are not ordinary people.\n",

      "When we recall those who paid the ultimate price for quality education, don\\'t forget current learners who are still struggling for decent schooling. For one who was at the coal face of the Soweto student march on June 16 1976, when I reminisce about that Wednesday, I battle to block tears from welling up like a river behind my eyes.Any regrets for dismantling Afrikaans as a medium of instruction for content subjects in our schools? Not at all. I am proud to have been part of that generation of Soweto students, who with nothing more than stones, bricks and garbage lids, brought the repressive apartheid government to its knees.Consequent to our relentless war against the might of the then fully resourced oppressive police and defence forces, who with their heavy machine guns mowed down some of our fellow students, even though we were in school uniforms, the nations of the world, as states party to the United Nations, declared apartheid a crime against humanity on July 18 (former president Nelson Mandela\\'s birthday) 1977.But the apartheid government still showed the UN the middle finger, just 43 days after the declaration of the apartheid Convention by the UN, by murdering one of our leading voices against apartheid, Bantu Steve Biko.So determined was the Soweto Class of 1976, together with all the other oppressed young people who had joined us in our quest to free South Africa from apartheid bondage, that the apartheid security forces failed dismally to deter us from forging ahead with our just cause for quality education and a democratic South Africa.Eighteen years later, after our nonstop rebellion against apartheid government misrule, it was full of feeling to witness the election of Madiba in Parliament on May 9 1994 as the first democratically elected president of a South Africa. Today, I still hear the voices of two distinguished freedom fighters who nominated and seconded him respectively on that day, Mama Albertina Sisulu and now the current President Cyril Ramaphosa.I felt that my fellow students who paid the supreme price, death in 1976, and those thereafter didn\\'t sacrifice their lives in vain. Of course, the struggle for our freedom was not only waged by the youth of 1976, but also by the many freedom fighters who lit the fire in us.We defeated apartheid bantu education early in our struggle for quality education and the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction was stillborn because of our determination.My profound concern is that, 42 years since that fateful period — and we, the then lions of the 1976 generation, are ageing and most of us have reached the 60-year mark — the black child still is confronted with many challenges at school.Learners face obstacles of a different kind. Drugs are a problem today, even as they were during my time, but the degree of the problem is obviously different. Many young students of my era were in the grip of dagga and alcohol but today many dangerous drugs are readily available to learners.Compounding today\\'s learners\\' problems is that too little investment was made — and still isn\\'t being made — in the infrastructure of our schools in Soweto and in all other townships. But learners in the rural areas of our country are the hardest hit, having to learn under conditions that in some instances border on violating their constitutional rights to dignity.In 2014, a six-year-old learner, Michael Komape, drowned in faeces in a school pit toilet in a village in Limpopo. Four years later, in March 2018, in Bizana in the Eastern Cape, five-year-old learner Viwe Jali died in a similar way. Occurrences of this nature — young learners who die undignified deaths in our democratic dispensation — make me bleed to no end.I appreciate that our sacrifice is recognised and celebrated in various ways every year. But have these celebrations just become a by-the-way tradition, where we go to rallies, old geysers who wear uniforms in remembrance of June 16 1976 and walk a few steps and pretend to emulate the class of Soweto 1976?I submit that perhaps these celebrations could be used to greater effect if we were to score ourselves on this day to see if we can say without fear of contradiction that the schools in Soweto, in the other townships and in the rural areas in particular can compete equally in terms of infrastructure with schools in the previously advantaged white schools during apartheid.The Tshilidzi Lower Primary where I commenced my sub A in 1964, the Mambo Higher Primary School where I did my higher primary education, and the Sekano Ntoane High School where I said no to Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in 1976, all these schools in terms of infrastructural investment since the advent of our democracy haven\\'t improved much.Neither have Musi High in Pimville, Madibane in Diepkloof, Orlando West High, Orlando High, Meadowlands High, Morris Isaacson and Naledi High. They are all more or less in the same state as Sekano Ntoane. And these were the seven high schools in Soweto that marshalled the 1976 Soweto students uprisings.Wouldn\\'t it be a great idea, when we celebrate the June 16 cohorts, to commit ourselves as a country to see that all schools in the townships and rural areas receive a massive infrastructural investment so that many of our learners in these areas don\\'t have to commute daily to far-flung former previously advantaged white model C schools in cities like Johannesburg to get a decent education?\n",

      "Part II: Journalists helped pull SA back from a precipice by exposing the depth of state capture. But they are now staring into an abyss of their own ANALYSISInvestigative journalists helped pull South Africa back from a precipice by exposing the depth of state capture. But they are now staring into an abyss of their own: populist hostility, a funding crisis and waning public trust. On balance, our press remains one of the freest in the world - but for how long? By Carlos AmatoPART IIThe glory of the leaked Gupta emails didn\\'t last long. Just 18 months later, despite its pivotal role in the defeat of state capture, the South African press is embattled. Revenues continue to dwindle, and retrenchments have hit newsrooms hard, notably at the Independent group and Tiso Blackstar. To make matters worse, the fourth estate finds itself bludgeoned with lies and threats. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who had previously opposed the Zuma-Gupta cabal, have launched a crude disinformation campaign against a list of journalists it calls the Ramaphosa Defence Force (RDF). This is a strategy of diversionary retaliation. It was employed after press investigations implicated EFF leaders Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu in the VBS Mutual bank heist. (The fact that ANC officials in Limpopo were enablers of much of the R1.8-billion theft has not received much coverage. This is because the party\\'s appetite for criminality has become commonplace and because EFF hypocrisy — it has defined itself as a righteous scourge of corrupt politicians — is more newsworthy.) The Mail & Guardian\\'s Thanduxolo Jika is not surprised by the EFF\\'s adventures in fake news. \"I find it appallingly hypocritical that they are attacking journalists\\' integrity — particularly the narrative they present that we are instruments of \\'white monopoly capital\\', which doesn\\'t want black people to prosper — when, in fact, the EFF has helped to exploit poor black people in the VBS case. \"But it\\'s nothing new,\" he said. \"There has always been a rocky relationship between politicians and journalists. It\\'s a difficult environment to live in.\" Jika cites as a precedent the then ANC spokesperson Jackson Mthembu\\'s klunky chant: \"Don\\'t buy City Press, don\\'t buy!\" But a call for a boycott is a long way from a threat of bloodshed. Addressing protesters outside the Zondo commission into state capture, which is taking place in the building occupied by Tiso Blackstar, Malema made threats regarding the EFF\\'s fight with an alleged cabal of Minister Pravin Gordhan: \"There will be casualties … there might even be a loss of life.\" Malema also made implicit threats against the so-called RDF journalists he links to Gordhan: \"Attend to them decisively,\" he urged EFF supporters. He covered his tracks with a little caveat: \"... engage with them from a civilised point of view\". Malema has previous\\' when it comes to war talk. And there\\'s a case to be made that many journalists took too long to wake up to the toxicity of racial essentialism and \"rhetorical\" violence. From the outset, the EFF was a story. Malema became an asset in the struggle against state capture. He was a juicy source, both on and off record. He rocked the musty old boat of Parliament and lit up the theatre of our politics. His broadsides against white South Africans were seen as a salutary riposte to white racism and complacency. It is only now that he is slandering journalists and Indian South Africans that a broad media consensus is turning against him. Financial Mail deputy editor Sikonathi Mantshantsha was one of the journalists singled out by Malema. He won himself a volley of vitriol for wryly tweeting a cellphone video, filmed from his office window, of Malema and Shivambu leaving the EFF\\'s Zondo commission protest in a Mercedes-Benz shuttle. But Mantshantsha scoffs at the \"desperate\" tactics of the EFF — and whoever else tries to scare him off. He argues that such attacks are doomed to fail and, if anything, they will sort the real journalists from the dilettantes. \"Those people who will be intimidated do not belong in the newsroom in the first place,\" he said. There is a place for this brand of unflinching bravado. Mantshantsha has demonstrated resilience and investigative skill with his exposés of Gupta corruption at Eskom. Scorpio\\'s Pauli van Wyk is cut from the same cloth. They are among the warrior-sleuths for whom South African politics is a Manichaean battle between the good guys and the bad guys. There is one true and indivisible story, however complex and hard to pin down it might be. That conviction is the lifeblood of investigative journalism. But even so, the decisions journalists make about which corner of that one, true story to attack are often — if not always — steered by their sympathies. The Bosasa (African Global Operations) and Andile Ramaphosa story has received much less coverage than the EFF and VBS story. The president later clarified that the R500000 was a donation to his campaign and not a contract with his son. He said the money would be returned to Gavin Watson, chief executive of Bosasa. Some of that asymmetry is justifiable because the EFF\\'s unhinged reaction to the VBS reports has become a story in itself. Even so, there are clear signs that our press corps, on balance, is going easy on the man who wields enough power, and apparently the will, to lift South Africa from its morass. As Jika said: \"We should not be entrenching ourselves and choosing sides. There are no angels.\" When asked whether there has been a pro-Ramaphosa bias across the major media platforms since his presidency began, Van Wyk bristled: \"Why are we even arguing this point of ideological bias? Because of state capture. That is the root cause. [Multinational public relations company] Bell Pottinger had a game to play, classifying the media as anti-Gupta, antiblack, and the ANC adopted this narrative, and the EFF took off on their own tangent. \"Of course no journalist is objective — we are all products of our society and our space. I\\'m a white female, 32 years old, and that has baggage. But then there\\'s Ranjeni Munusamy, Sikonathi Mantshantsha, Rob Rose, amaBhungane, Branko Brkic. How do you get all those people into one ideological box?\" Branko Brkic: \"I immediately thought, this is bigger than the Daily Maverick; this had to be industry-wide.\"But, she added: \"I don\\'t want Cyril [Ramaphosa] to succeed. I want the country to succeed. If Cyril can make that happen, great. But he\\'s not above scrutiny.\" If anyone can speak from experience about the risks of following one\\'s political sympathies as a news journalist, it is Ranjeni Munusamy. As the daughter of the town barber in Dannhauser, a coal-mining town in KwaZulu-Natal, and granddaughter of the town barman, she grew up listening to stories, and has never stopped. She is now a political commentator for Tiso Blackstar and a prime target for the EFF\\'s press-bashing efforts. But, in 2003, she lost her job at the Sunday Times and her reputation in the industry when she leaked a story to the City Press that the former head of the National Prosecuting Authority, Bulelani Ngcuka, had been investigated by ANC spooks for being an apartheid-era spy. Munusamy had pitched the story to the Sunday Times, but the editors didn\\'t bite. Munusamy said her sympathy for Zuma at the time was based on her experiences while covering politics in Ulundi in the mid-1990s, when it was still a war zone. \"Zuma would invite us journalists to his house in the parliamentary village and tell us his stories about the struggle,\" she said. \"It was so fresh then. Stories about Lusaka and Swaziland and Robben Island, stories of personal encounters that you would never hear normally. \"I remember sitting on the floor in that house, which was full of people — officials, MECs, all the journalists — and listening. It was so powerful at the time, coming from someone so essential to the ANC. That is where the relationship and the respect came from. He was very charismatic. It was a safe space to be. And it was an amazing time to be alive, during the transition. Freedom fighters were trying to find their way in the world.\" But the freedom fighter in question found the wrong way in the world. After the Ngcuka furore, Munusamy was pulled ever deeper into the Zuma vortex. First he was charged with arms-deal corruption, and she believed he was being persecuted as a rival by the Thabo Mbeki cabal. Munusamy was approached to set up a website associated with the Friends of Jacob Zuma Trust and agreed to do so, for no pay. Ranjeni Munusamy: \"There\\'s no possible way for me to try to be \\'fair\\' on the Gupta agenda. Never going to happen.\"Then Zuma was charged with raping Fezekile \"Khwezi\" Kuzwayo and subsequently acquitted. It was the beginning of the erosion of her trust in Zuma, which culminated after he became president, when his corruption and incompetence finally became inescapable. \"My involvement in Zuma\\'s political and legal battles had damaged me so severely that I hardly recognised myself. I wanted to rebuild my life, and restore whatever I could of myself,\" she wrote in the Daily Maverick in 2012, soon after she returned to full-time writing at the insistence of Brkic. Munusamy has had to be tough to endure her ostracism as a Zuma apparatchik and then to rehabilitate herself in the public eye. But she is not too tough to reflect on why she had to grow a hard shell in the first place. \"I understand people\\'s dislike for me,\" she said. \"It\\'s very difficult to be a prominent journalist with a big voice and be liked. From my early years in journalism, I developed a hard personality as a defence mechanism. To almost become a bitch, who didn\\'t care what people thought.\" Long before her entanglement in the Zuma story, she placed herself in the firing line as a young reporter covering the Inkatha-ANC conflict zones in KwaZulu-Natal for the Sunday Times. \"Sometimes I would be on the scene of a massacre before the police got there, so I would stand there and hold somebody\\'s hand while they died. And then afterwards try to tell the story dispassionately. I had no idea that we were undergoing trauma for a sustained period of time. None of us did.\" She laughs now about her gung-ho approach in the killing fields. \"I was really stupid. Once a warlord said to me, \\'How do you still stay alive? You know we tried to kill you so many times. You must have a very strong muthi. How is that you don\\'t die?\\' And I honestly don\\'t know. I was able to go into conflict zones on my own. \"When Sifiso Nkabinde, the Richmond warlord, was killed, I went there on my own and sat on this deserted road outside his home and waited for his bodyguard. He had also been shot and I knew he was being discharged from hospital. \"Eventually the bodyguard stood up in the bushes and said: \\'What are you doing?\\' And I said: \\'I\\'m waiting for you.\\' And he said: \\'But I can shoot you.\\' And I said: \\'Ah, but I know you won\\'t.\\' I didn\\'t ask him any questions then, but then he said: \\'Can you come back tomorrow?\\' So I did, and he told me what happened. He told me who had shot Nkabinde. And he took me to his hideout, where his guns were hidden, and our photographer came and took pictures of them.\" Even in peacetime, there is an emotional toll on journalists. We are more vulnerable to depression than most other professions. \"You\\'re supposed to reflect everyday reality — the good and the bad and the ugly,\" said Munusamy. \"But more often it\\'s the ugly that\\'s the story. And you\\'re there, at the coalface of the ugly. And at times the ugly penetrates you.\" Nowadays, Munusamy is covering another war — a digital information war. Like all high-profile journalists who command large audiences in the frenetic trenches of Twitter, Munusamy is both an observer and a participant. That ambiguous position adds grist to the mill of Malema and his right-wing populist equivalents — United States President Donald Trump, Hungarian leader Viktor OrbÃ¡n, former United Kingdom Independence Party leader Nigel Farage and Brazil\\'s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro. It\\'s easy to launch a populist attack on the mainstream media, which, for all its real flaws, has been forced into an semi-activist role to maintain its moral centre. The political commitments of journalists are easily framed as unprofessional bias. But journalistic ethics have never required the erasure of conscience. To attempt an impartial commentary on a mafia state, and on those who defend its dormant remains, would be absurd. \"There\\'s no possible way for me to try to be \\'fair\\' on the Gupta agenda. Never going to happen,\" said Munusamy. So what happens now? How do journalists report dispassionately on an erratic and vengeful actor like the EFF, which scorns the old rules of engagement? Until four or five years ago, there was an awkward and tense but broadly respectful dance of mutual dependency between politicians and the media. No longer. The brawl of Twitter has stopped the dance. For Munusamy, there is no easy way out of this toxic dynamic. \"The debate now is whether [the EFF] was given too much of a wide berth — whether it got too much attention. \"And when I covered the last US elections, I saw their media going through exactly the same convulsions with Trump. On the eve of the elections, they were saying, \\'Oh fuck, did we create this? And what do we do now?\\'\" The stakes are always high when the press is cast as an enemy of the people, as Munusamy saw during a visit to Turkey in 2015. At the time, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was beginning his persecution of reporters and editors. \"I kept asking people why they were really not bothered by it,\" she said. \"Life was going on as normal. Journalists would be arrested or sued, and there was no outrage in society about it. And that is how it built up to the stage where Turkey now has the most journalists in jail in the world.\" Press freedom in South Africa remains far from the Turkey scenario, but only vigilance — both outward and inward — will keep journalists free.Read part III here: Uncaptured — Newsroom weaknesses and the trap of false narratives\n",

He was elected in April, after a motion of no confidence in the union\\'s former national leaders, who were accused by Samwu\\'s central executive committee of failing to act in \"the interest of municipal workers\". Samwu, with about 160000 members, is the country\\'s biggest municipal union. It represents workers at the coal face of service in municipalities. But for half a decade it has been plagued by infighting over allegations of wide-scale financial mismanagement. READ MORE: Cosatu to command problem unionsLast month, a leaked forensic audit report into Samwu\\'s finances confirmed that more than R88-million had disappeared from the union\\'s coffers between 2012 and 2015. Samwu has also haemorrhaged members over the years. In 2015, two splinter unions — the Municipal and Allied Trade Union of South Africa (Matusa) and the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (Demawusa) — were formed by purged Samwu officials. Some had been expelled from Samwu because they had called for a forensic audit into the union\\'s finances. Matusa and Demawusa are affiliates of the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu), which was formed by expelled Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi. Samwu\\'s plan to bring itself back from the brink harks back to the ideals of its founding leaders, which include the establishment of a worker-centred union that is united against the privatisation of municipal services. Ramotlou said: \"We require grounded leadership on exactly what we are supposed to be doing as an organisation. Most importantly, we must look at the value we put on worker issues. That requires the leadership to refocus those within the organisation. \"We don\\'t all have to agree, but at least there must be principles that we are driving the union towards.\" He said Samwu\\'s current leaders want to restore the union to how it was under its founding president, Petrus Mashishi, who died last year. Also a founding member of Cosatu, Mashishi railed against corruption, outsourcing and failed service delivery, which he warned would weaken the federation and its alliance partners. In practical terms, Ramotlou said restoration means guarding the union from private entities, which he said drive corruption. \"From our assessment now, what destroys the organisation … is having service providers in the union. Because they come with different interests, they undermine collective agreements. \"That is one area that is destroying the trade union movement. It stops the union from focusing on what it is supposed to do.\" Samwu\\'s solution is to get rid of service providers, Ramotlou said. \"That is one area that we are focusing on to ensure that we remain independent … The independence of the union must be safeguarded at all costs.\" READ MORE: Efforts to curb fraud, waste and abuse of medical aids necessary to keep costs lowHe said the union also intends to tackle the role of \"middlemen\" in providing services to municipalities. \"We don\\'t see any value in municipalities having a middle person to deliver services. We don\\'t agree with that arrangement, because that means that municipalities are deliberately not planning to build internal capacity, which is what they must do … Once you have service provision being done by private companies, it disempowers [ward] councillors.\" Regarding the country\\'s municipal elections to be held in 2021, Samwu wants to see municipalities \"preparing to build internal capacity\", Ramotlou said. \"Whether parties or councillors change, the function of the municipality must be stable. You don\\'t need a councillor for water to run. You don\\'t need a councillor for a clinic to operate. You don\\'t need a councillor to have ambulances running.\" Ramotlou said it is in the interest of the public to have one, united municipal workers union. Samwu intends to formally write to the splinter unions in an effort to unite them. \"We are doing this for the benefit of municipal workers. There is no reason for us to be fragmented because that weakens the power of workers,\" he said. Ramotlou said he is not concerned about the apparent ideological divide between the Saftu-affiliated unions and Samwu. While Cosatu is aligned to the ANC, Saftu is independent of any political party and is often openly critical of the governing party. \"Ideologically, for comrades who are in Demawusa and Matusa there is not such a big difference in what they want for municipal workers. Because we must first start with what makes you what you are. And that is members,\" Ramotlou said. He added: \"If the basis for a member to be in a trade union is about political affiliation, then we won\\'t have any trade unions.\" The plan to reach out to expelled members seems to come with obstacles. Matusa general secretary Kurt Ziervogel said the unity of municipal workers is \"sacrosanct\". But, he added, \"this unity agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. It is like a veneer, to gloss over the bigger issues that Samwu is facing. \"Some of us have advanced to where we don\\'t want to sit in Cosatu any more,\" he said, \"Because with Saftu, we have no alliance to a political party and that is appealing to many municipal workers.\" Although Ziervogel acknowledged that discussions between Matusa, Demawusa and Samwu may need to happen, Demawusa\\'s deputy general secretary Aaron Sekulane was less diplomatic. \"There is no way that we will be considering going back to Samwu. These are just tricks aimed at misleading workers,\" he said. \"Anything that is affiliated to Cosatu will not bring any change to the issues of the workers.\"\n",

      "The actress, who died this week, paved the way for generations of talent \"She could disarm you in seconds,\" says writer-directorQuanita Adams, who worked closely with Shaleen Surtie-Richards on her recently released movie,Swirl: A Letter to Hair on the Cape Flats.\\xa0 Surtie-Richards died on Monday morning at 66 years old at a guesthouse in Cape Town.\\xa0 In the public outpouring of love, where everybody grieves differently, it can be almost invasive to those who are particularly close to the deceased. For all the attempts at immortalising an icon, there\\'s no elegant way to sum up someone\\'s life. Not the life of Shaleen Surtie-Richards.\\xa0 Surtie-Richards\\' rise started with her award-winning role as Fiela in the filmFiela se Kind(1988). She then graced the screens of most of our childhood homes as Nenna in M-Net\\'s soapie,Egoli: Place of Gold. Her career extended beyond television to theatre with the one-woman showShirley Valentyn(2008), for which she won a Fleur du Cap award.\\xa0 My experience of her artistry started on my granny\\'s old-school TV when she used to watch her programme,Egoli, at the same time every evening. It was Nenna\\'s boldness, her love, her rings, her laugh, her effusiveness that made that time-slot a sacred and warm place for me.\\xa0 \"There were two things that she would never stop doing; she would never stop smoking and she would never stop swearing,\" laughs actress Vinette Ebrahim.\\xa0 Having bonded over years in the industry through shows, festivals and award ceremonies, Ebrahim focuses on the fun moments in her long-standing friendship with Surtie-Richards. \"She loved dropping the F-bomb, and the P-word. And, of course, she just always had a joke and some of them were really, really filthy. I couldn\\'t repeat some of the jokes that she told.\"\\xa0 WithEgolireruns and Surtie-Richards\\' life documentary,I Am Who I Am,currently screening on M-Net, Adams is still in mourning. She says, \"This idea of future nostalgia\" was not a thought. \"She was constant, she was going to be there.\" Reflecting on a bygone festival, Ebrahim recalls the two of them driving from Springbok to Upington to meet Surtie-Richards\\' family for breakfast.\\xa0 \"The birds were diving in front of the car to pick up the road-kill from the previous night. It was quite frightening because there were birds of all sizes and eventually Shaleen rolled down the window and put up her hand as a megaphone and shouted, \\'Sal alle fokken voeltjies nou fokken ophou\\'\\',\" says Ebrahim, \"And we were killing ourselves laughing.\" \"It brings you to the coal face of mortality, this idea of legacy,\" Adams sighs. \"I don\\'t know if she was necessarily about that. She was very clear about what she represented, but at the same time she was also quite irreverent about it.\"\\xa0 Surtie-Richards had two states, Adams says. \"You\\'re the golden circle or you buy the DVD at Game. And once you were in, you were in.\" Surtie-Richards\\' star quality was innate and effortless. Adams reflects that she was not deliberately trying to forward discourse and be politically disruptive. \"She was just, like, well I\\'m going to barrel ahead. It was so unselfconscious, it was so unmannered, it was not premeditated. And that\\'s what made her such a genuine fucking star, in the true sense of it.\"\\xa0 Just sometimes fans can get into your space a little bit, says Ebrahim. \"I will never forget her words to me when I started on7de Laan. she\\'d been onEgoli\\xa0for a good couple of years and she said to me, \\'My darling. Die dag gaan kom wanner jy nie eers by jou voordeur wil uitgaan om te gaan shop nie\\'.\"\\xa0 Ebrahim says Surtie-Richards would always say, \"Be gracious.\"\\xa0\\xa0 The two acted in the original production ofFiela se Kind,on7delaanand most recently inSwirl.\"Look, like me she had no formal training,\" says Ebrahim. \"We honed our craft in other ways.\"\\xa0 Ebrahim played her daughter inFiela se Kind. \"She was just a natural and I was entranced.\" Richards and Ebrahim came from an era before women of colour held legacy names in the industry. They came up as actresses in apartheid and they escalated to our stages and screens despite staggering oppression and odds.\\xa0 \"When she won the award forFiela se Kind, it was in the time of apartheid in 1986,\" says Ebrahim. \"There were still those people who wanted to hold the reins. This was being done at the NicoMalan and, yes, things were changing but there were still people, those who ran the production, the type of people who were saying \\'we will still make sure that you know your place\\'. They belittled her at every turn. \"And she stood tall and she stood strong. It gave us the leeway to say we will stand with her and we will stand next to her and we will have our say. When she won the award, I remember feeling just, \\'Thankyou Shaleen, for you, for all of us.\\' She opened doors for many of us because she just barged her way in. And she was so right in doing what she did.\" Ebrahim is frank about those days, \"The only roles that were available to us were those of the maids, the bediende in die huis tiepe ding.\"\\xa0 She is pleased to say that she and Richards played more robust characters than those stereotypical narrative props written to facilitate noninclusive storylines.\\xa0 InSwirl, Surtie-Richards delivered her swan song. \"I\\'d written that part for her specifically,\" says Adams, \"I mean, the joke of it is that the character was initially a chain-smoker, which she was very excited about.\" Her character of Ouma is one we know. She\\'s almost everyone\\'s aunty, our collective ma. You get the feeling that her character\\'s warmth is synonymous with Surtie-Richards\\' own warmth, and that the interplay between the actress and the character is intensely and naturally intimate.\\xa0 \"Fuck the lines, tell the story,\" is what Adams got from Surtie-Richards. Having written that part with her voice in Adams\\' head, and having worked with her before as an actor, the script was never about the lines. \"You script in pictures and in ideas and if she buys it, she will transform whatever you\\'ve put on the page and she\\'ll make magic.\"\\xa0 \"The love just trickled in from the top down,\" says her co-star Ebrahim, \"We as so-called coloured actresses were given the freedom to just be. I think what you saw inSwirlwas very much Shaleen herself.\" As a senior actor in South Africa, Ebrahim laments how actors died as paupers after entertaining a country. \"For me, the sad part about Shaleen\\'s passing is the way she passed. She was busy onArendsvlei,[a KykNet telenovela] and she was put into a guesthouse where she was there on her own. She was ill. They knew she was ill. And she died alone.\" Ebrahim says. \"There\\'s more to it than meets the eye. Older actors in this country are not well-looked after. We are not a priority in this country. We have nothing. We don\\'t have the luxury of pension or medical aid; it\\'s all got to come out of our own pockets, and by the time the tax man claims, we get half of what it is.\"\\xa0 Constance was the name of Surtie-Richard\\'s character inSwirl.Adams reflects that that is who she is - for the industry - whether Nenna, Fiela or Shirley Valentyn. \"She\\'s the genesis and the exodus, where it started for so many of us.\" The postThe irreverence of Shaleen Surtie-Richardsappeared first onThe Mail & Guardian.\n",

      "There are numerous means by which errant taxpayers can start the new year on a clean slate The North Coast of KwaZulu-Natal inspires with its complex palate of greens. From lush wood forests, and sugar cane fields to a cornucopia of fruit trees. My favourite is that of the young mango, which, when sliced and salted and offered up with vinegar and curry powder, serves as a time travel device to childhood. I recall devouring bite after bite, sitting in a tree, as my little feet gently pendulum swung in ecstasy. But the ubiquitous fruit is not only the stuff of memories, it is also the star of parables. To be green is to be in a state of learning and evolving toward the ripeness of experience and wisdom. As an entrepreneur you typically start out green. There is a lot you don\\'t know. You believe that the sheer beauty of your business idea is what will make it thrive and grow into a thing of stature and success. Sometimes we become so enamoured with the innovation, idea, or creation that it takes all our focus. The reality is that your business can only really grow and scale when the back end is correctly looked after. Accurate accounting, administration and record keeping are the supporting stars of a successful business. It is important that if you lack basic bookkeeping skills you may need to hire one or bring in the services of an accountant or tax practitioner. This does not mean you get to leave it all in their hands while you concoct your next move; in the end it is still your responsibility to ensure you remain tax compliant with theSouth African Revenue Services(Sars). And here is where many lose the plot. When it comes to company taxes, like most financial tasks, it comprises numerous tax types, including VAT and PAYE, together with multiple regulatory obligations. Failure to comply with the regulations could expose a small or medium business owner to a build-up of unpaid taxes, resulting in liability compounded every day by penalties and interest. I was commiserating with another business owner recently, discussing how this is a pitfall others fall prey to, typically because they left the responsibility to someone else, were ignorant of the process or too busy firefighting on the shop floor. In many instances finding oneself liable or non-compliant can threaten your survival or almost certainly deal a fatal blow to your business. We resolved that sharing the gospel of compliance and understanding of how this all works is an important crusade for us at the coal face of small, micro and medium enterprises (SMMEs) as an important propeller of our country\\'s economic growth. So what do we need to know and how do we stay compliant so that we can secure the contracts or land crucial funding to grow our enterprises and shrink the ranks of the unemployed? How do we become proactive, in correctly handling our tax affairs, especially if we have to remedy non-compliance? One of the ways is to ask those who know. Jashwin Baijoo, the legal manager atTax ConsultingSouth Africa, advocates staying tax compliant from the outset. And here\\'s his five point plan on how you do that. 1. Ensure you are registered for corporate income tax, skills development levy, PAYE, UIF and VAT, if your annual turnover is projected to exceed R1-million. 2. Submit all your return types on time on their correct dates, and the bi-annual EMP501 (employees\\' earnings) reconciliations if required. 3. Double-check all calculations pre-submission, even if they are completed by a qualified accountant or tax practitioner. Remember, the buck stops with you as the business owner. 4. Settle any liability rightfully due to Sars, as and when it is raised. This avoids the levying of interest and penalties. 5. Finally, should you disagree with a liability claimed by Sars, or be unable to afford it, consult a tax attorney immediately as we find Sars quite amicable in instances where the correct legal course is followed. But let\\'s say you misstepped, overlooked or just didn\\'t know all these things and Sars is knocking on your door, either through a Letter of Final Demand \"(the Demand\"), a third party appointment or some other means of collection. You can either become paralysed by the fear of how you will pay what\\'s due and whether Sars will attach your property or drain your account, measures which Baijoo says they are legally entitled to, or you can take some action. He explains there are numerous means by which errant taxpayers can start the new year on a clean slate, with the most cost efficient of them all being a Compromise of Tax Debt application (\"the Compromise\"). \"This is aimed at aiding taxpayers, both SMMEs and individuals alike, in reducing their tax liability by means of a Compromise Agreement (\"the Agreement\") and helping to keep the cash constrained taxpayer afloat until some financial reprieve is in sight,\" says Baijoo. Baijoo adds that where Sars is approached correctly, and with strong merits, a tax debt can be reduced and the balance paid off in terms of the Compromise, allowing some much-needed breathing room and helping SMMEs all over the country to become tax compliant and remain a going-concern for the foreseeable future. So, I hope this goes some way in helping you not only stay afloat, but helps you harness your engines to travel this sometimes unknown and seemingly unnavigable path. Good luck.

      "Given its rich heritage, the area should be considered a historically important site in which black landowner rights are integral \"The government knows about Evaton!\" This sentiment is clearly conveyed by those who have been at the coal face of the Evaton/Wildebeesfontein land claim since 1998 to date.\\xa0 Evaton is part of the Wildebeesfontein farm, a freehold area that lies South of Johannesburg. The Evaton case, in its intricate and multifaceted nature, is crucial in understanding the shortcomings of national institutions constituted to address land restitution. The situation is further exacerbated by bureaucratic bungling and political myopia - the inclination towards short-term self-interest and the failure to realise the true meaning of land justice.\\xa0\\xa0 In this flawed system, it is the older generations fighting to reclaim their land and youth whose lives are compromised by the injustices that fall victim to what can only be described as secondary dispossession - a post-apartheid land capture.\\xa0 In many ways, the Evaton case shows that land dispossession is not a single event but is being repeated. In trying to \"solve\" the land question through a complex legal process in democratic South Africa, the onus of claiming and resulting litigation costs fall onto the dispossessed and more dilemmas arise.\\xa0 The case of Evaton, it can be argued, is a reminder that the broader question of land restitution, while anchored in human rights, is implicated in a capitalistic, legal form. Moreover, the protracted claims processes lead to obfuscation, confusion, indignation, betrayal, desperation and unnecessary conflict between claimant groups and communities. It is important, therefore, to set the record straight. Just recently, on 12 May 2022,Newzroom Afrikareported evictions resulting from \"the illegal sale of land\" in Evaton. Amid disturbing scenes of people\\'s brick houses being bulldozed, evoking apartheid-era forced removals, a man named Andrew Molefe confidently confirms that he is \"legally approved by the National Department of Human Settlements (NDHS) to work with them to bridge the gap for people who do not qualify for RDP houses and also for bond houses\".\\xa0 Families were charged R22\\xa0000 each in what the media terms an \"illegal sale\" but what Molefe calls an allocation fee. Molefe points out that the money goes to the Wildebees Properties and Project Co-operative, which belongs to the Wildebees community. Those who paid to be allocated stands received no title deed. Asked about whether the land is privately owned, Molefe agreed but stated that it is community-owned. He also acknowledges that although the claim \"is still in court\", it has been gazetted and \"is not yet finalised\".\\xa0 NDHS reported that it distances itself from the Wildebees Properties and Project Co-operative while Molefe faces charges of fraud. In this situation, one can begin to see how flawed the government\\'s approach to land restitution is. The design of the restitution system in South Africa - state institutions and how they position the Communal Property Associations (CPA) and co-operatives model - creates situations that have an adverse effect.\\xa0\\xa0 In Evaton, this unsettling situation has a century-old history that when disentangled shows how there has been continued systematic dispossession by the state during apartheid and in the post-1994 democratic era. Furthermore, private interests by developers and those prospecting for mineral wealth and recognising the agricultural production potential of the area also decelerate the broader quest for land justice and, in Evaton, for the return of land to the descendants of freehold title holders.\\xa0 Since freehold titles grant the owner what is above and below the ground, the situation faced by Evaton stand-owners can be characterised as a \"resource curse\".\\xa0 The dimension of mineral wealth in Evaton has not only drawn the attention of the government but also the world\\'s mining houses. The latter fact has been perceived as the key reason for the recurring dispossession which opens a plethora of questions related to the municipality, its relations with the mineral houses and its scant regard of people, even where there are documented, legally binding agreements. All this shows how government institutions are failing people.\\xa0 In herMail and Guardianarticle, \"Urge for Action on Land Reform\", Bulelwa Mabasa argues that South Africa is \"faced with an urgent and dire need for land justice\". The fact that the \"dwindling\" budget allocation for the Department of Land Reform, Rural Development and Agriculture has led to what Mabasa refers to as \"the castration of the effectiveness of key institutions such as the Commission of Restitution of Land Rights\", is further cause for concern.\\xa0 Issues that are resurfacing in Evaton today are rooted in land acquisitions dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The area known today as Evaton is part of a much larger tract of land called \"Wildebeesfontein\" farm. It was home to local Nguni, BaSotho and BaTswana who were displaced by the 1840s when the region was occupied by the Dutch Voortrekkers and became part of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, one of the Boer republics.\\xa0 It is presumed that the area was transferred to WJ Viljoen in 1864 and then to the Jouberts in 1894. After the Boers lost the South African war (Anglo-Boer war) in 1902, the area was annexed for British settlement and the return of Boers who had lost their farms during the war. The British colonial administrator, Lord AlfredMilnerregarded the Dutch as \"rural\" and \"agriculturally unprogressive\", arguing, \"I wish to place on record my profound conviction that unless, in raising these loans, we provide a substantial sum for the purchase of land and the settlement thereon of farmers of British race, an opportunity will be lost which will never recur\". Milnerism, however, would also lead to the stripping of the rights of black people. Although black participation in the war was on both sides (British and Boer), some had fought voluntarily \"to regain the land they had lost to the Voortrekkers much earlier and at the end of the war, black people resisted leaving their farms\" (Gilliomee and Mbenga 2007). The signing of the Vereeniging peace agreement was also met with scepticism by black leaders. It was in this interregnum that British soldiers Thomas Adams and Charles John Easton, who had fought in the South African war, acquired this vast area.\\xa0 Around 1904-1905, Adams and Easton subdivided the land into plots and sold them to Africans and Europeans at £20-£25 per acre (about 4\\xa0000m²) under freehold title. It is, of course, remarkable that these acquisitions that made it possible for Africans to rightfully possess land with freehold title deeds, took place at a time when the Volksraad Resolution in 1855 and 1857 excluded Africans from privately owning land, which they could only register in the name of a public official through an \"in trust\" system and during the build-up to the 1913 Land Act that would later restrict African land ownership.\\xa0 Scholars attribute these early acquisitions to the famed victory of Reverend Edward Tsewu who won the case where the Transvaal Supreme Court ruled that \"the Registrar of Deeds must allow the transfer of land to Africans in their own names\" (Feinberg 2009). It is argued that Adams and Easton sold land to Africans motivated by the role they played in the South African war. It could also be surmised agricultural productivity motivated the sale of land to skilled African farmers.\\xa0 The name \"Evaton\" was coined when Thomas Adams\\'s adopted child, Eva Adams, inherited a portion of the Wildebeesfontein farm, which was referred to as \"Eva\\'s Township\". In the 1930s, a further portion of the Wildebeesfontein farm was made available to Africans when Thomas Adams\\'s widow, Elizabeth Frances Ligertwood, referred to as MaAdams, received permission from the government to sell 400 acres to Africans at an inflated price of £50 per acre. These smaller stands are known today as Small Farms, where Ligertwood\\'s grave is. The area became dynamic and cosmopolitan in the early 20th century. The cosmopolitan nature of Evaton became a beacon of hope, attracting political leaders and activists throughout the continent and globally. Not only was it agriculturally prosperous but also became an intellectual and cultural hub with pan-African institutions. Schools like St. Lukes and Methodist Missionary Schools were established. It is also where the renowned prophetess Christina Mokutuli Nku and her husband Lazarus Mosioa Nku built the pan-African Africa Independent Church St. Johns, and established schools, horse-riding stables and soccer clubs in the area.\\xa0 African intellectuals and African-American missionaries who came to the area built institutions, one of them being the prominent Wilberforce college. It was built on land purchased by Reverend Jantjie Zacharia Tantsi and with the backing of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church. This is where Marshall and Charlotte Makgomo Manya-Maxeke came to teach after completing their studies in the US.\\xa0 Political figures like Dr Alfred Bathini Xuma, president-general of the ANC in the 1940s, were on the board of trustees. The leading communist militant and Wilberforce teacher Albert Nzula lived in Evaton and taught at Wilberforce. He joined the Communist Party, became its general secretary and died in Moscow in 1933 after his sympathies for Trotsky\\'s ideas became evident and he was told by Stalin\\'s henchmen that he could never return to South Africa.\\xa0 In the 1950s, Evaton was the centre of the bus boycotts catalysed by activists such as Levai Mbatha, Joseph Sallie Poonyane Molefi and Vusimuzi Make who led the boycott and were later arrested for treason, becoming \"treason\" trialists.\\xa0 It is also rarely known that the protests called by the PAC against pass laws and culminated in the Sharpeville massacre on 21 March 1960 were initially organised in Residensia, Evaton, led by ZB Molete, David Sibeko, Gabriel Sandamela and Vusi Linda Make. Many celebrated boxers, tennis players, equestrians and other famed personalities such as talk show host Felicia Mabuza-Suttle and singer Rebecca Malope once called Evaton home.\\xa0 With this layered and valuable heritage, the Evaton restitution case should no longer be ignored.\\xa0 The land claim in Evaton also needs to be understood against the backdrop of persistent struggles by Evaton stand owners and tenants against the apartheid regime which sought to destroy Evaton because it was an anomaly. Evaton had landowners of different \"races\" until the 1950s when the Group Areas Act assigned people to racial groups and to separate areas.\\xa0 Residensia in Evaton was declared a white area but given its proximity to predominantly black residents of Evaton and clashes over grazing land, white residents were later moved to areas such as Meyerton and about 200 African families who resided in Meyerton were forcibly removed and re-settled in Residensia and Sebokeng. The apartheid state initially refused to recognise black land ownership and withheld municipal services. In the 1960s, the establishment of development boards set in motion another attempt to expropriate land. In Evaton, the development board introduced a lodgers permit fee and resumed unfairly charging double the rent to freehold title holders.\\xa0 These gross measures unjustly turned freeholders into tenants on their own property. A report by Iso Lomuzi (\"The Eye of Evaton\"), an organisation that fought against the usurping of freehold title deeds by local apartheid structures, shows how development boards set up these charges, forcing freehold title holders into debt that would lead to a sale in execution, stripping the title holder of their property.\\xa0 In 1965, the Sebokeng management board served as a pilot scheme for other township administration boards. It was succeeded by the Vaal Triangle administration board and, given its \"powers\" to expropriate land, it set to purchase the land on which Evaton was built. In many cases, no or little reimbursement was offered to African property owners - some were, instead, offered leased houses while others were dumped in places like Hammanskraal. By 1984, the rent increase and levy of R5.90 (increasing it from R62 to R67.90 monthly) were announced. Residential permits for stand-holders were raised by R6. Furthermore, the electricity levy and unit price was increased, inciting a rent boycott and stay away. A year later, development boards were abolished and Mojapelo challenged parliament on the question of freehold land. The context of the rent boycott defined the struggle to be that of land, and parliament in 1986 then responded with a document recognising the freehold status of Evaton/Wildebeesfontein. In response to the forced removals, which increased exponentially, Iso Lomuzi became an authentic organ of resistance together with the liberation movement, converging on the perspective that \"land is freedom\". They challenged the levies charged by the Orange-Vaal development board and other similar strategies aimed at invalidating the freehold status of Evaton. Legally represented by Phosa and Mojapelo Attorneys, Iso Lomuzi and its subsequent iterations, like the Wildebeesfontein Evaton Standowners Association (WESA), highlighted the importance of a legal route and vocal opposition.\\xa0 After the fierce combined resistance of 1984-1985 against the apartheid government, the state conceded and acknowledged expropriated land in Evaton. This explicit recognition that Evaton was bequeathed to Africans was announced in parliament in March 1986 and in a letter written to Phosa and Mojapelo attorneys. This announcement was rejected by Afrikaner nationalists (Die Verkrampte). Two years later, on 29 September 1988, the announcement was defied. Evaton was rezoned, its status of freehold changed to leasehold and stand numbers were changed. All this was done without drawing the attention of the public. It is in this context - a democratic post-1994 South Africa haunted by its past - that a land claim was lodged. In the media, a few articles have been published about the land claim that was filed in 1998, but those articles seem to leave out many details and, as such, can be misleading. For example, in 2008, theMail and Guardianpublished anarticlewhich focuses on the Wildebeesfontein Evaton Community Organisation (WECO) which claimed to have been \"the only entity capable of negotiating a [R48 million] settlement with the government.\"\\xa0 Anotherarticle, first published inGroundUpand later byDaily Maverick, notes that although Evaton appears to have \"nothing particularly noteworthy\", but it \"has an interesting legal claim for land restitution that could run into billions of rands\". It is perhaps the question of what is at stake that has intensified the land claim struggle and obscured the socio-economic and political significance of land, which is eclipsed by monetary compensation.\\xa0 Several other articles point out the protracted struggles between the Wildebeesfontein Evaton Community Association (WECA) and WECO, but very few mention Tuis September (founding chair of WECA) and the poet and activist Thamsanqa Zondo (deputy chair of WECA), both of whom have been at the coalface of the land claim struggle among others. September and D Qupe initiated the original claim of the Wildebeeste farm through the Land Commissioner in December 1998. Qupe claimed Evaton in the district of Vereeniging. September claimed a couple of individual stands and the entire Wildebeesfontein freehold. Both applications were ignored for 16 years. It was only in 2014 when the attorney Sundeep Singh filed an application for the restitution of Wildebeesfontein farm at the Randburg land claims court, that the claim received attention. The application was opposed by the land commissioner and three municipalities who later retreated from the opposition. The land commissioner was taken to court and when asked by the judge why it had taken so long to address the application, the land commissioner claimed that the application had not been filled correctly, even though the onus is on the commissioner\\'s office to advise claimants. September, limited by the level of literacy, relied on Themba Mthwalo of Sebokeng (Zone 13) in drafting the founding affidavit for the claim. September was acting on behalf of WESA, an organisation that was formed with the aim to protect the freehold rights of Evaton residents and led by John Nhlapo, Gilmon Nkuta, Baba Simelane and Baba Shabangu (Mabechu).\\xa0 It was formed after the Evaton Ratepayers Association (ERPA), led by Mr Kabi and Oupa Olifant, was established in 1978 to prevent the sub-division of Evaton and the stripping of freehold titles. The formation of these associations was indicative of the pressures faced by black landowners in South Africa during the apartheid years, and both were the products of Iso Lomuzi. September was swayed by the argument put forward at the land commission that a claim under a body formed by stand owners, the Evaton Standowners Association, would exclude tenants. This led to the claim being registered under the Wildebeesfontein EvatonCommunityAssociation (WECA), as opposed to Standowners, a change that would dilute the pursuit of those in possession of freehold title deeds. Compounding this was the delineation on mineral rights, which differentiated the ownership of what is above ground and below.Ciaran Ryanpoints out that \"the terms of the title also vest surface and mining rights with the community\" yet \"the Minerals Act vests all surface mineral rights with the state\". This positions the claim against seven mining companies. With so much at stake, breakaway groups were formed, such as WECO (established by Mthwalo, who helped September with the original claim, the Evaton Land Claimants Community (ELCC), Evaton Heritage Trust Council and the Community Functionary Team (CFT), the latter of which were founded with information from September but are now in opposition to him.\\xa0 WECO sought to place itself as the original claimant. As the WECO chairperson at the time,Mthwalo, stated that \"the regional land claims commissioner accepted the merits of the claim over [the entire] farm\" but \"the applicant community was surprised to see an article in Sowetan newspaper on 23 August stating the Wildebeesfontein community was compensated to the tune of R48 million in settlement of their land claim action, but the applicant community knows of no such settlement\".\\xa0 Sello Alcocknoted that \"the settlement offer presented in 2004, agreed to by the former minister of land affairs Thoko Didiza in 2006, and seen by theMail & Guardian, shows that the majority of the 293 claimants accepted monetary compensation\". WECO\\'s claims were dismissed and they opened a case against September where they claimed to be claimants and lost. In addition, Mthwalo was expelled later, during the leadership of Joseph Mahlaba. Sundeep and his brother Minesh Singh were both attorneys of WECA but interacted with most stakeholders for the sake of unity. During this time, WECA had progressed in the case and following the February 2014 judgment, the court ordered for September\\'s claim to be gazetted. After the land commissioner failed to act upon this order, an application for the contempt of a court order was filed against the commissioner in December 2014. Represented by Singh attorneys, WECA won and the claim was gazetted. The gazetting was seen by some as approval of the land claim and release of the land to claimants.\\xa0 Given the confusion and misunderstanding, mistrust settled among members. Some felt betrayed while others took the gazette as an indication of the finalisation of the claim and, without awaiting the necessary verification, moved into some of the areas and began developing, jeopardising the legal process.\\xa0 With most people not understanding the processes of the Restitution Act which restricts the sale, exchange, donation, leasing, subdivision, rezoning and development of claimed land, the areas stated in the gazette were apportioned and sold by sections of the community and by the government. This was reported to the land commissioner, but the lack of response was taken as an indication that there was nothing wrong with the apportioning.\\xa0 The reluctance of the land commissioner to address this case adequately also caused delays and obfuscated the original objectives. After the failure to follow the court order, the land commissioner instrumentalised Section 10(4) of the Restitution Act to question the validity of the claim by questioning whether the claimant was the real community representative, forcing after-the-fact elections that subordinated the claimant, September, creating internal divisions that would further protract the claim. After delays, on 19 November 2019 in the Randburg land claims court, WECA was given a list of areas which needed to be verified.\\xa0 It transpired later that the land commissioner did not gazette all the land parcels stated in the 2014 court order. Again, the commissioner was taken to court and lost. The claimant was required to verify his claim through an expert historical report. The land commissioner proposed a meeting on 5 December 2019 with the objective to discuss the scale of the land under question. The meeting did not materialise. At the time, the commissioner had positioned himself as a claimant. Towards the end of that year, the attorneys were not paid, and when Covid-19 struck, they were eventually fired. September instructed his spokesperson to investigate the complexities of the case and to find out what was to be done in the absence of lawyers. When members of WECA met with the land commissioner in Pretoria, the Court Order of 19 November 2019 and the reinstatement plea about the attorneys were sidelined.\\xa0 This was considered to be part of a strategy to push for an out-of-court settlement - a diversion from the court settlement that has been pursued by WECA. The relationship would also deteriorate when a CFT lawyer was invited to a meeting between the commissioner and WECA, where the commissioner insisted that he does not address associations but claimants. The spokesperson, who insisted on not deviating from the court order, was threatened. Letters from WECA seeking to address these issues have been sent to parliament and the president of the land claims court.\\xa0 On 11 June 2021, a forced out-of-court settlement was imposed on WECA by the land commissioner. Given the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions of 2020 and 2021, the lack of legal representation and the worsening health condition of September, WECA\\'s position was weakened.\\xa0 The land commissioner re-established the Land Claims Committee (LCC) as the sole authentic representative of the claim, side-lined WECA lawyers and imposed the CFT lawyer on the claim. This also contributed to the divisions. Consequently, there were further break-ups within the LCC and CFT. Within the CFT, now involving September\\'s son, the critically ill September was pulled from his sickbed and made to rubber-stamp CFT perspectives in Pretoria.\\xa0 The CFT lawyer also drafted a memorandum of agreement that removed the power of the people of Evaton or Wildebeesfontein from their hands, placing it in the structures established by CFT lawyers. Notably, the Wildebeesfontein claim, in terms of the MOA, was being removed under the Restitution Act and placed under the Khoisan and Traditional Leadership Act which dilutes the freehold right of Evaton.\\xa0 So far, the land commissioner has not publicly announced his legal land offer to Wildebeesfontein as would be expected. What was discovered during 2020 was that the land commissioner had apportioned Wildebeesfontein 536 IQ despite the court order of 19 November 2019 which required verification by claimants.\\xa0 This secondary land capture has created a situation where developers can sell to other people the land belonging to title holders. In other words, developers are among the first beneficiaries of land capture. Likewise, the local government is implicated in similar acts, where a municipality will apportion to itself claimed land and devise its own project.\\xa0 This is the precarity of land claims in South Africa. It is a major blind spot of the South African government where post-1994 neoliberal democracy co-exists with apartheid legacies.\\xa0 A place like Evaton and the struggles for restitution serve as an example of the injustices of recurrent land dispossession.\\xa0 Significant to this matter is how the state has handled it, leading to the intensified struggle between many associations, creating paranoia, and effectively fracturing the collective voice of the Evaton community, leaving it divided by the politicking that has derailed the claim.\\xa0 The intergenerational injury endured in the loss and reclaiming of land remains unaccounted for. Given its rich heritage, Evaton/ Wildebeesfontein should be considered a historically important site in which black landowner rights are integral. For these, and many other reasons, Evaton can no longer be ignored. The views expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of theMail & Guardian.

      "Sustainability literacy is about understanding the intertwining of people, planet and profit\\xa0 The Graduate School of Business & Leadership (GSB&L) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal is preoccupied with how executive leaders and managers in different organisations practise sustainable leadership. Extreme environmental problems such as floods and excessive heat, triggered by the effects of unsustainable business models, are increasing in frequency, intensity and complexity. Organisations and people continue to face more and more intense disruptive incidents that invoke the necessity of sustainable leadership capability as a new organisational and societal priority.\\xa0 The pressure on leaders to balance profit, the planet and people cannot be handled effectively by leadership whose understanding of leadership effectiveness focuses exclusively on the organisation\\'s values and inward-focused metrics without concern for the broader society.\\xa0Aish Hinton, Head of Global Marketing at WDHB says sustainable leadership is a type of leadership that drives solutions for environmental, social and economic challenges in the world. Sustainable leadership as solution There is a growing need for theories, models and practices of sustainable leadership more aligned to the holistic and long-term pursuit of sustainable organisations and interconnected society. The challenge is the limited models based on the South African environment. Academics and students at GSB&L are aware of the depressing pace of how executive leaders and managers are enacting sustainable leadership. Robert Swan says the greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it. The positive trend of having new sustainable leadership roles in organisations, such as chief sustainability officer, is notable but inadequate as it lacks scale in the actual practice of sustainable leadership in day-to-day activities at the coal face. Progress is needed to discredit and replace unsustainable business models and beliefs. Academics and students at GSB&L are intensifying the examination of the nature of sustainable leadership, identifying pitfalls and developing new models that unravel the element which comprise this capability.\\xa0 Research by students in the Masters of Commerce Leadership Studies Programme shows that sustainable leadership capability is multi-dimensional and integrates seven capabilities. These leaders demonstrate sustainable literacy by understanding the intertwining of people, planet and profit dimensions of sustainability in the environment and the organisation. Another capability is systems thinking in knowing the business system, entrepreneurial thinking and integrating these with sustainability. As system thinkers, sustainable leaders have a holistic view of an organisation and link parts of the system to create effective processes and avoid practices with unintended and possibly negative results as much as possible. Sustainable leaders are prepared to share the leadership responsibility with others to achieve organisational outcomes. The capability of managing impact and influence by building partnerships, encouraging and supporting operational and strategic sustainability is also critical for sustainable leadership. Creating value with all stakeholders enhances influence through inclusivity. Strategic thinking capability helps to set clear direction, alignment and commitment to sustainability and strategic flexibility. Equally important is the capability of developing sustainable human resources and nurturing sustainability expertise. Effective communication across traditional functions for sustainability and modelling of sustainability for others is essential. Sustainable leaders pay attention to what they reward, punish and applaud as these are critical in building a sustainability culture. Leaders are key in shaping the sustainable beliefs and values of employees. The lack of relevant sustainable skills within personnel, failure to develop internal capacity for sustainability and delays in decision-making processes due to lack of sustainable expertise do not reflect a sustainable culture. Sustainable leaders ensure the development of others by supporting sustainable training and development in their organisations.\\xa0 Why is sustainable leadership not common? The studies by students in Masters of Commerce Leadership also reveal that critical gaps in the sustainable leadership practice of executives and managers are silo behaviours of not engaging employees in sustainable-related decisions, which undermines collaborative work for sustainability. When employees are disengaged, they begin to withdraw and hide their ideas and feelings, adversely affecting sustainability and systemic work performance. Employee empowerment and participation through engagement are vital elements in entrenching sustainable leadership practices at different levels of the organisation. Empowerment means giving employees some concessions and authority to make decisions on their accord, which is critical to avoid the inadvertent sustenance of a silo mentality. Other impediments are strategic failures to develop sustainable human resources and enforcing green management practices and green innovation, which ignore sustainability\\'s people and profit aspects. Green management practices are narrow, predominantly operational and weak, and are also poorly strategised to create and develop a lasting sustainability culture. Changing people for a better world At the GSB&L, we are ready not just to share our research findings in classes but also welcome you on the research journey as a postgraduate student researching exciting issues which impact businesses, our lives and society today and in future. Our Masters of Commerce Students have already researched sustainable leadership practices in hospitals, ports, universities and hospitality settings, to mention a few.

      "LETTERS TO THE EDITORPlease explain where Zumaville funding is coming fromREPORTS of a new R2-billion town (Zumaville) to be built at PresidentJacob Zuma\\'svillage, Nkandla, are of great concern. They are particularly worrying because at no stage did the minister of finance indicate during this year\\'s budget speech that such an allocation had been made for the development of Nkandla. Even this year\\'s budget vote 33 on rural development and land reform makes no mention of a massive development programme planned for Nkandla.The reports about Zumaville have been going on for weeks without a word from government.It seems the government thinks that by ignoring them and the people\\'s concerns about the matter - the uproar about Zumaville - will [make it] go away.The United Democratic Movement (UDM) calls on the minister of finance to explain to South Africa whether national resources have been diverted from other departments to the Zumaville project.If yes, which departments have been affected by this and why?We also call on him to explain the reported involvement of China in this deal and what the conditions and implications of the existence of such a deal are for South Africa. - Bantu Holomisa, MP, UDM presidentFighting good fightWHAT a moving story about coal mining in Indwe by your reporters Bongani Fezile and Siya Miti, titled \"It\\'s a matter of sheer survival at the coalface\".What saddens me about the matter is the opportunity that is being missed for true Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) to take place. Here you have a community doing something to make a living for themselves and all that is needed is for their activities to be legalised and for support to be provided in terms of equipment and on business management and safety issues.This does not happen, instead an outsider is given a licence to mine and displace locals. The local miners are not even given a stake in the business, but outsiders are brought in as BEE partners.We have seen examples of this in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, which had the potential to kill the taxi industry and rob thousands of families of their means of earning a living. Instead of taxi owners being allowed to participate as part-owners of the system - for example, government building the BRT lanes and taxi-owners buying the buses - they were prevented from doing so until violence broke out and were grudgingly brought in as owners in the Johannesburg leg of BRT at least.I take my hat off to Sydney Stina of the Indwe Legal Advice Office for taking this fight up to protect the rights of the community. - N Gongxeka, Beacon BayTenders must ceaseI WISH to thank the Daily Dispatch and the University of Fort Hare for this week\\'s dialogue with professors Somadoda Fikeni and William Gumede who shared with us insights about South East Asia and Africa.I agree that Gumede, the author of Restless Nation, is writing at an appropriate time when South Africa faces many challenges.The dumping of textbooks in Limpopo and in the Eastern Cape tells us the system of tendering to individuals needs to come to an end. The delays in delivering text books and the reason for our children\\'s suffering is tenderpreneurship. - Thabang Mokoena-Maseko, MdantsanePrice of farm killingsANOTHER farmer was murdered on the weekend on his farm in the Eastern Cape. Owen Charles has served his Jansenville community in myriad ways as a liberal activist over the last two decades. His wife, Jenny, is in hospital in a critical condition with multiple stab wounds. We wish to convey our deepest condolences to the Charles family.This senseless loss of life is a tragedy not only in itself, but also for the knock-on effects that such a murder has on rural communities across the country. It is not a once-off murder, but the latest in a persistently escalating string of farm attacks. Tholeni village, for instance, has been labelled the \"village of death\". Another murder there on the weekend is one of dozens in the last year, and one of more than 3000 attacks since 1994.The failure of government to prevent farm murders is one of collective governance. There is clearly a lack of political will to protect farmers and farm workers, even though farm workers are the ones whose families are most in jeopardy as a result of these attacks. This lack of political will translates into a lack of any robust plan for rural safety. Meanwhile, ministers have spent a collective R530.6-million of taxpayers\\' money on VIP protection services to ensure their own personal safety over 2010-11.In the midst of rising food prices and impending food insecurity, the negative downstream effects of even one farm murder cannot be overstated. It creates the kind of insecurity that disincentivises both investment and reinvestment in agriculture, a cornerstone of government\\'s draft National Development Plan. The cost is ultimately felt by all South Africans. Taking out a progressive farmer is like removing a spoke in the wheel of rural economies. It has a devastating effect all along the supply chain, leading to joblessness and further entrenching avoidable poverty.The DA has made repeated calls for rural safety units to be established, yet Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa has done nothing to fill the security void left when the commando system was finally disbanded in 2009. The ministers of agriculture and rural development seem to think the issue is not their responsibility or not sufficiently important to take seriously.My colleague Dianne Kohler-Barnard last month wrote to Mthethwa and the new national police commissioner to ask where government\\'s proposed rural safety plan is. National spokesperson Mmusi Maimane has sent a copy of the DA\\'s rural safety plan blueprint to the president.Neither action elicited even the courtesy of a response.Clearly those at the highest level of government have more concern for their own safety than the safety of those who feed the nation. -Athol Trollip, MP, DA Shadow Minister of Rural Development and Land ReformWILLIAM GUMEDE\n",

      "TWO scenarios played out in different towns last week. In one council in Emalahleni Municipality, Mpumalanga, the newly appointed mayor Lindiwe Ntshalintshali came into office with a list of priorities as all politicians do when they assume office. But topping her to-do list was the need to get a brand new car, one with a hefty price tag of R1.5-million. Just over 100km from the town formerly known as Witbank, the new mayor of Tshwane, Solly Msimang, also attended to the important matter of the council executive\\'s fleet.But unlike Ntshalintshali, he rejected the 10 luxury BMWs that had been ordered by the erstwhile Tshwane executive led by his predecessor Kgosientso Ramokgopa.Instead he opted for Hyundai i20s and Toyota Corollas which he said were capable of doing as good a job transporting a politician as any sedan could.With R1.5-million, Msimang can afford five of the cars he is looking for, yet Ntshalintshali and her officials see nothing wrong in acquiring such an expensive car for her exclusive use.Ntshalintshali\\'s behaviour demonstrates a politician not in touch with the reality on the ground.Her conduct plays itself into all sorts of stereotypes about politicians being seen as greedy, self-serving leeches who see their elevation to higher office as a ticket to the feeding trough. She did not invent the phenomenon but has replicated it well.Obviously she sees nothing wrong with driving an expensive sedan in a poor town whose economy is dependent on coal mining.Msimang\\'s conduct is commendable and should be an example to other politicians, especially at local government level which is at the coal face of service delivery.But he is not the only one. Before him, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan drove an old Lexus which had cost R500000 when it was bought. Also the late minister in the Presidency Collins Chabane travelled in a fairly modest VW Tiguan.When she was mayor of Cape Town, Helen Zille cruised around in an environmental friendly hybrid Toyota Prius.What this country needs are more politicians like that - leaders who can demonstrate to the population that there is nothing wrong with living modestly.This type of leader sends a message that public office if not a get-rich-quick scheme but about serving the citizens of that locality, province or country.Perhaps the recent local government elections - with the equal number of metros in DA hands as there are in ANC hands - will usher in a new way of thinking in government. As politicians fight for votes and their continued stay in power, maybe they will also learn to do more to earn those votes. Arrogant politicians who continue to behave like Ntshalintshali can only be punished in the polls.They should be careful that they do not lose those fast cars as soon as they received them.

      "The running of the Mdantsane Kazi 10km on Sunday will be a celebration of athletic endeavour in the province and will conjure up many memories of earlier races, people and incredible moments in the development of road running and indeed the country as a whole. It is a history many will feel proud to have been a part of and one that should never be forgotten.Mdantsane has given the running community many fine athletes, people and a heritage that endures.My fondest memory of Mdantsane is of measuring the course for the first well-sponsored race back in 1990. It was a 15km and although I cannot remember exactly who all was there, I do recall riding my Peugeot bicycle with measuring device attached. Border Road Running stalwart John Davies was documenting progress as well as giving direction and Bhisho-based William Henna offered advice on the route.We were something of an oddity to the people on the streets back then and attracted much interest.The first race was a great success, despite the turbulent times of the impending fall of apartheid. Two of Mdantsane\\'s greatest sons were involved with Mzwandile Shube winning the race and Makaya Masumpa being part of the President Steyn Mine team that won the team prize.In fact the team consisted of three local men, Masumpa, Mthunzi Dyonase and Tembinkozi Bishop. The fourth member was one of the greatest athletes produced in Southern Africa, Lesotho-born Vincent Rakabaele, at that stage a veteran.The race only lasted three years due to the political changes and the Bhisho massacre in particular.Other renowned athletes to win or play a leading part in the results included Ezeal Thlobo and Michael Scout from Port Elizabeth, both prominent in South African road running circles.Other legends of the sport included Thabang Baholo, Lizanne Holmes, Edwin Lwana and Dyonase, who won the 1992 event.Dyonase sent a host of great old photographs through just last week, perhaps perfectly timed for a moment of nostalgia in the streets this weekend.Former Daily Dispatch editor, Glyn Williams, was the first grandmaster home in 1990 and those at the coal face of the sport at that time will never forget the affable running journalist Elliot Mtshozeni who lived in Mdantsane.Race director of Sunday\\'s race, Alex Kambule, said this week that \"old horse\" Masumpa will be running again and has participated in every edition of the Kazi 10.There have since been numerous other races on those hilly roads, but it is fair to say that the Kazi 10 might be considered the reincarnation of the 1990-92 pioneer project and as such is today the flagship race of Mdantsane.There are so many fine athletes of yesteryear who instil pride in Border sport and from whom today\\'s athletes can learn much.While we journey down memory lane, next weekend will be the first running of the Tony Viljoen marathon without the great man being present. His memory will tower over the event nonetheless.\n",

How are we going to save our indigenous animals so that people can see them in their natural habitat?\"Pickover said: \"Promotion of Access to Information Act applications sent in over the years in relation to wildlife issues have not been responded to by the provincial department.\"In fact, they have never bothered to respond. So the public\\'s right to know, access to information and transparency - the bedrock of democracies - is being severely affected,\" she said.Pickover said it was important that the government not get left behind as other countries were taking bold steps to protect wildlife and nature.\"This includes ensuring that there is proper and effective verification, compliance, enforcement and oversight by the authorities tasked to take care of precious wild spaces and wildlife.\"There is biodiversity loss, land and ocean degradation, pollution and resource depletion. Climate change is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. Globally 83% of all mammals and half of all plants have been destroyed and one million wildlife species now face extinction,\" Pickover said.\n",

      "Sanity has prevailed. This is probably the best way to sum up the Eastern Cape government\\'s U-turn on renewing the contracts of its nursing interns. On Thursday this paper reported that 625 nurses had been left out in the cold after the provincial health department decided not to renew their contracts. It cited lack of finances to pay their stipends. The nurses, who were working on one-year internship contracts, were at the coal face fighting the coronavirus at a time when our province was pronounced as one of the hotspots in the country.As the global pandemic continues to wreak havoc, after death one of the worst fears for most people is losing their livelihood. These nurses are no exception, hence they cried foul when the department handled their contracts so badly.We welcome the decision announced on Thursday that the nurses will, after all, be absorbed into the province\\'s system following an intervention by premier Oscar Mabuyane and director-general Mbulelo Sogoni.However, questions still have to be asked, including why these nurses had to go through so much anxiety before they could be absorbed.In a similar incident in January, we reported that Amathole district municipality had issued a circular indicating that their 1,670 employees, councillors and traditional leaders would not be paid for four months. That shocking decision was reversed within 10 days, once again after the intervention of provincial and national officials.Does this mean that our elected officials only react when issues are highlighted in the media? We certainly hope not, as that would be a travesty of justice for the electorate. The solutions that seem to be an afterthought are not good for anyone.While Covid infection and death statistics are steadily retreating across the province, we are surely still not out of the woods. Hence the decision to drop 625 nurses defies logic.Not only are many of the nurses breadwinners in their families but to their patients in public hospitals, they are life savers. It is well documented that provincial public health facilities are understaffed, this means trainee nurses play a pivotal role.It is our hope that the government will act on its announcement and promptly absorb these women and men so that they can again take up their rightful front-line positions in the fight against Covid-19.\n",

      "Western Cape\\'s Nomafrench Mbombo says so-called \\'experts\\' are undermining public interest and putting lives at riskWestern Cape health ministry has had enoughTANYA FARBERAs they intubate patients, doctors and nurses in the Western Cape hear \"regrets being expressed\" by those same patients who chose not to be vaccinated and are now fighting for their lives. The provincial health minister, Dr Nomafrench Mbombo, who was a clinician for a long time before she became a politician, is gobsmacked by non-expert opinions undermining vaccine efforts in the province.She said on Thursday: \"In all my career previously as a healthcare worker and clinician, then as an educator and a researcher, and now as a politician, I have never seen a disease that has so many people becoming not only opinionated, but also believing that they\\'re experts.\"She said she \"shares the frustration of healthcare workers who\\'re the ones being affected by vaccine hesitancy not just around the province, but the country as a whole\".Comparing the current crisis with previous epidemics such as HIV, she said back then people \"valued information they got from medical and healthcare experts\".She added: \"Healthcare services are our ministry\\'s core business, but health is everyone\\'s business, and we are not saying we should have a monopoly over information, but when people spread fake news they are undermining what is in the public interest.\"People are ignoring what healthcare workers are seeing every day, said Mbombo.\"If you don\\'t believe us, come and see for yourself - you will find 3,400 beds occupied by Covid-19 patients, many of whom chose not to get the vaccine. If you don\\'t understand 17,000 deaths from Covid-19 in the province, come to our mass facility centre in Tygerberg and see those 32 bodies that are there each day,\" she added.Mbombo said in December alone 45 health workers died in the Western Cape.In the past month, now that vaccines are having their effect, there have only been 21 deaths \"and the majority of those are in people who were not vaccinated\".The flipside of stamping out hesitancy is increasing access.The province, according to Mbombo, partnered with GrandWest Casino and Entertainment World to assist factory workers to get jabs, while other \"non-health\" sites were also being used to attract young people.On September 1 \"we will be at a club in Khayelitsha offering vaccines to young people who are normally patrons at that club by night\", she said.Other pop-ups include a student residence at the University of Cape Town (UCT), various taxi ranks and church youth group meeting places.Provincial head of health Dr Keith Cloete said healthcare workers at the coal face were not just dealing with statistics, but real people whose faces they had come to know in ICU.Cloete, who has calmly delivered a digital press conference every week since the pandemic began, has had enough of those who \"callously and irresponsibly [influence] people to not get vaccinated\".\"Our health workers are the ones having to contact those families to say your loved one did not survive,\" he said, \"and this is what our young doctors, nurses and experienced specialists have been going through for more than 18 months now.\"He said they were under \"tremendous pressure every single day\" and that \"more and more they are treating people who are not vaccinated\".This makes it \"very hard for that doctor or nurse to be treating someone with severe disease who had the opportunity to be vaccinated, but did not take it. They can hear the stories of regret just before they get intubated, and that is the destruction of a life.\"\"Health workers feel betrayed by that person and by those who are callously and irresponsibly influencing people not to get vaccinated,\" he said.-Sunday Times DailyGETTING ON BOARD: Nomafrench Mbombo has called on people in the Western Cape to stop spreading fake news, which is undermining the vaccine rollout.

      "Frankly SpeakingExodus of youth from our province sadly mirrors our colonial pastAccording to the Eastern Cape Socio-Economic Consultative Council (ECSECC), young people are leaving the province in search of employment.Essentially this is the old colonial and apartheid system, 28 years into the democratic era. The colonial and apartheid systems were designed to keep rural areas as reserves of labour.The labour from these parts and other bantustans was to be exploited long enough to exhaust the vigour of youth.After the depletion of that vigour, labourers would be sent back to the reserves to await their demise.Even as the skills associated with the then emerging mining economy grew, the skills and labour kept on leaving our largely rural province for use and deployment in relatively advanced parts of the country such as the cities.It is a terrible indictment of the ANC-led democratic era that we have hardly moved the needle in this regard.We have failed dismally to ensure that the skills and labour of the Eastern Cape and other provinces are utilised in those provinces to speed up their economic development.It has long been painfully obvious, as the auditor-general, Tsakani Maluleke, observed once more in her annual report, that the municipalities are incapable of this task.The famous \"coal face\" of governance has been a complete disaster which has disempowered our people in a myriad of creatively destructive ways.The provincial governments have not been much better.The Eastern Cape has the highest unemployment rate among the youth aged 15-24 at a whooping 73.5%.Even in cases where the youth are employed, they are largely employed in low wage jobs, further restricting their contribution towards the economic development of the province and the country.None of these figures even remotely reflect the devastating psychological impact they have on the minds of our youth.The sense of self-worth, which was already historically at a deficit because of colonialism and apartheid has found no relief during our era.It is very tempting for each of us to surmise that this is not our fault, that it is the fault of the ANC-led government that our youth, the hope of the future has been left hanging in this way.While this may be true to a great extent, this situation cannot be left unresolved.Failure to address this situation is akin to participating in the destruction of SA by wilfully disempowering its prospective future contributors.As a result, desperately needed skills and talent are not only leaving our province, but our country as well.In a country that has been fed the politically convenient lie that ideology is the answer to everything, skills and talent continue to prove that they cannot be forced by ideology to stay here.No skilled or talented individual wants to live in a society where everything is crumbling; where electricity, water, refuse collection, or just basic safety is largely not guaranteed.How will they express their ideas, talent and skill in an environment that actively chokes the life out of every valuable thing, valuable idea, and even the valuable vigour of youth?Which country allows gangsters to call themselves business forums?However, the challenge remains. As long as we live here, we have to turn this around.Obviously, most of the people who have been trained in the current political system and have internalised the current political culture are most unlikely to bring solutions to this malaise.We must realise that our hopes were misplaced in politics, since its main concern is staking a claim on South Africa.Staking a claim has not produced anything of value, it cannot do so.What we need is to build. It is only when we build that we can realise and increase value in our country.Building requires an entirely different attitude, together with that mainstay of building, a collective effort.No amount of demand for jobs will realise jobs as long as no businesses are built.No businesses will be built as long as no suitable attitude and skills are acquired to build them.No businesses can be sustained as long as we fail to build common ground between capital, labour, technology and enabling policies.To simplify this, our entrepreneurs need to realise that we need their skills to co-ordinate the efforts of South Africans, marshal available resources and realise the most common dreams our people carry.This role must be snatched from the politicians and taken up by proactive South Africans who have built up the skills to pull this off, full stop.We will gladly pay you!\n",

      "The race arrives and we are worried \"I have not done enough\".It is a common lament as the coal face looms of that one meaningful race.It need not necessarily be long in distance, though when it is, the spotlight is more sustained and concentration levels are crucial. Given that the Comrades Marathon is but two weeks away, these thoughts and concerns come into play.That said, however, it is well-documented that it is better to arrive at the start of so tough a task being under- rather than over-trained, an adage not every runner buys into.On Tuesday, at the culmination of the recent long weekend, I was returning from Kei Mouth and drove past numerous runners embarking on a long run.I cannot be sure, but they were close to the Morgan Bay turn-off, which is in the region of 40km from the N2 at Mooiplaas.They were most probably training for the prestigious 90km race from Pietermaritzburg to Durban and would probably have ended on 50-60km, which is just too much.The scenario is not unique in road running circles and many runners, regardless of their experience or ability have followed similar training patterns at stages of their careers.Comrades Marathon runners are correct to seek advice from those who have gone before, as there is a dearth of experienced coaches.It can work, provided there is a successful track record to follow.The might of the hills encountered on the Comrades route means there is such a fine line between success and the possibility of an uncomfortable, even painful day out.Every decision made, from the journey to the start, to the early pace, nutrition, identifying the hills heard of and how much effort to put into them, the downhills included, is crucial to the journey.Runners are currently faced with mid-August weather, which is generally unpredictable, as indeed we discovered last weekend.The \"lights and power out\" situation has not helped preparations either. Runners require stability at such times.I met with a runner this week who has dreamt of race day, of missing the start, of finding a catch-up path, but on a different imaginary road.The stories may be amusing, but they are real and could well endure in the build up to the world\\'s greatest ultra-marathon on Sunday August 28.To put it bluntly, the long distance training is done, or not.The speed and hill sessions are all but done, or not.There is little, other than common running sense that is going to deliver a desired result in 2022 with such a short period remaining to the start pistol at the Pietermaritzburg City Hall.I had a long chat to Helen Lucre, a previous Comrades Marathon winner, during the week.Always interesting and insightful, Helen won the race three times in a row from 1985 to 1987, recording a best time of 6:48:42.She was more than just a Comrades runner, however, and represented KwaZulu-Natal at every distance, from 10km to the marathon.A great runner and her thoughts will be shared with Comrades runners during the two weeks that follow.The good news is that Lucre will be on the 2022 commentary team and she is one of the most eloquent of commentators.She does her homework thoroughly and is up to speed with the leading contenders, inclusive of some of our local athletes who it is believed will feature prominently.Fifteen days to go and they are crucial..\n",

      "Letter/ Economic development must benefit entire ECEconomic development must benefit all of usThe state of the Eastern Cape\\'s economic landscape is one of inequality, characterised by race and geographical location. Economic programmes have been actively pursued by the government, however, such efforts have not meaningfully transformed the economic patterns we inherited from apartheid\\'s spatial planning. The dominant economic zones we inherited, such as Gqeberha and East London, to this day remain the main drivers of the provincial economy.But areas that used to constitute the former homelands remain without economic zones.We must then ask how is local government going to propel development in these areas?This question arises from the socio-economic challenges confronting the different spheres of government, in particular the local sphere which is at the coal face of our people.Rising unemployment and wage disparities culminate in poverty, increasing crime and depleted moral fibre within our communities. The question equally arises from unequal spatial planning in the province which favours the metropolitan municipalities in terms of stimulating economic growth.How are the six district municipalities expected to meaningfully address the triple challenges when industries are concentrated in the two metropolitan municipalities?We will be told our metros have existing infrastructure that attracts investors. Well, that infrastructure was not always there, it was developed over time. Why can\\'t the same energy be applied to the district municipalities so their communities can equally benefit from the economic spin-offs of having industries within their areas?The restructuring of the province\\'s uneven economic landscape should be facilitated by the provincial government through the department of economic development, addressing local economic development in our two metros, six districts and 31 municipalities.The department of economic development can benchmark on how the Municipal Infrastructure Grant is implemented. Without the MIG, municipalities cannot implement infrastructure programmes within their jurisdiction. The funding from the infrastructure grant emanates from national. Economic nodes in municipalities should be identified and strategies developed on how best to unleash their potential.Investors must also be incentivised by provincial government to take their businesses to the districts. Such endeavours will close historical and present spatial planning gaps, which unevenly capacitates municipalities in addressing the challenges of inequality, poverty and unemployment.- local government functionary writing in his personal capacity\n",

      "A KwaZulu-Natal DA councillor is in hot water after she circulated a voice note in which she said she was disappointed an Indian-dominated community elected a black woman to the ward committee. Connie Hariram, ward 3 councillor in Newcastle, allegedly made the recording after ward elections in February and sent it to a WhatsApp community group.In it, she said the election of then Abathu Bantu Congress candidate Thandeka Reed in February 2022 was the worst and most stressful day.\"I\\'m so disappointed that I could cry. What some of you have done has really disappointed me. That lady, Thandeka, is a black lady and we were all Indians there. Who voted for her? The Indians. The people that I\\'m talking to right now, their people, and family and friends voted for her,\" she said.\"I\\'m very disappointed and I don\\'t know what to say and what to do.\"Contacted for comment, Hariram referred queries to provincial leadership.DA provincial spokesperson Sthe Ngema said the party had taken action on the matter. He said when the allegations surfaced, an investigation was launched and concluded before the end of 2022.\"The councillor in question has admitted guilt and expressed remorse. The DA will now consider the investigation outcomes, along with admissions made by the councillor,\" said Ngema.Reed told TimesLIVE she was made aware of the voice note in September.\"I have made a number of attempts to ensure this is dealt with, but there is no progress. The municipality was aware of this and I even went as far as reporting it to the Human Rights Commission in December.\"We didn\\'t know each other. I only knew her from the posters and I guess she didn\\'t like me and didn\\'t like the fact the community members elected me while I\\'m black. I haven\\'t rested and won\\'t rest until justice is done,\" said Reed.On Tuesday, KZN co-operative governance & traditional affairs (Cogta) MEC Sihle Zikalala asked the municipality\\'s speaker to investigate the allegations. He said councillors were public representatives and should work towards creating social cohesion within their communities.Saying someone should not have been elected to a ward committee because of their skin colour is distasteful and unfitting of a public representative, said Zikalala.\"The sphere of local government is at the coal face of service delivery and therefore needs leaders who have empathy and a willingness to work with all people, irrespective of race, culture and creed.\"The speaker of the municipality is duty-bound to investigate these alleged utterances by the councillor to see if they are in breach of the council\\'s code of conduct,\" he added.The department also warned councillors about the seriousness of the oath they took when sworn in.ActionSA KZN chair Zwakele Mncwango also questioned municipal inaction on the matter.Mncwango, the former DA KZN leader, said Reed lodged a complaint with the municipality in October, but there was no response.IN HOT WATER: The DA in KwaZulu-Natal says the party had taken action against Newcastle DA councillor Connie Hariram who is accused of making racist remarks.

      "\\'IT\\'S SO sad. All they sometimes need is love. You go up to a group of 2-year-olds and one will hold your leg to get your attention. Once you begin interacting with him then the rest will follow and soon you\\'ll have children clambering all over you, and the first one who was there will push the others away to maximise this interaction.\" These are the words of Mohamed Fayaz Khan, president of the Durban and District Child Welfare, who has to find R16 million a year to keep the vital organisation going. He says the very nature of child welfare puts restrictions on raising funds for the cause. Exposing the young people who are beneficiaries is \"an absolute no no\". \"We do not even brand our vehicles as they are sometimes used to transport children from court to their community, \" says Khan. In spite of such obstacles, he believes it\\'s time for a radical new take on raising money for child welfare to fulfil his aim of significantly improving the quality of life of the children of Durban. He does not wish to leave behind the legacy of merely having kept overheads low. \"People don\\'t view overheads as part of the solution, but they are,\" says the electrical engineer who has been nominated for the annual Inyathelo Philanthropic Awards. The awards honour individuals who commit their personal resources towards broader social development in South Africa. Candidates are nominated by their peers and members of the communities in which they work, or by the non-profit organisations that they support. \"We need to slowly and responsibly move out of the concept of zero risk,\" says Khan. \"In the past three of four years we have been bringing in a corporate culture to the board,\" he adds. This has resulted in significant reductions in organisational operational expenses. He believes that it is now time to bring that same corporate ideology to marketing and income generation for the organisation. \"If we want to make money here we must do some intelligent investment, applying the same principles we use in businesses.\" Khan needs to raise in excess of R16m a year to supplement the equivalent in state subsidies to run the outfit that accommodates 200 orphans in residences and provides community services to countless others. But to achieve his R32m operating budget, his non-profit, non-governmental organisation must conquer challenges that would not exist in the business world. Firstly, in the profit sector one may make an investment and grow a business expecting to only begin seeing a return many years down the line. \"There\\'s nothing wrong with that. Even if one fails, it\\'s just business.\" Similar principles are not accepted in the non-profit sector. Secondly, there are severe limits to how much one can promote the cause, after all, the aim of Child Welfare is certainly not to go around telling the world the status of its children. \"We do not take pictures of our children for marketing.\" This helps fuel the perception that Child Welfare - the largest welfare organisation in the country - is a state entity, which it is not. \"We rely very heavily on the much-needed contributions of businesses, trusts and individuals who have supported us over many years, but the problems we face as a society are getting bigger and so to are the resources required to tackle these problems.\" He hopes that holding flagship events will help in getting around these obstacles. Coming up soon will be the screening of the movie We Are Batman, the rights to which the Durban and District Child Welfare has acquired to screen in South Africa. Khan was overwhelmed by the success of Mandela Day this year. \"It is my experience that people want to give and contribute but need to be guided on how they can make a difference. It is part of our duty to help facilitate that process.\" Khan\\'s presidential position does not only bring financial challenges. It brings emotional ones, too. \"Giving money is easy. The social workers are the real heroes . I wonder how they go home and rid themselves of the baggage (that they pick up during the day), and come back the next day with the same vigour and passion to continue to help those in need? Khan primarily deals with governing the institution but he is occasionally exposed to its coal face. Khan and his wife, Themesha, are both electrical engineers who have chosen to be employed in the service sector as a means of contributing to society. They have often dug into their own pockets to provide the staff with luxuries that some could consider extravagances. These include giving them a Christmas party or sponsoring staff awards. \"I take my hat off to my staff. Society often asks people to make an unfair choice. You either work for yourself (and make money), or you work for the betterment of humankind and accept that you won\\'t earn much.\" Khan\\'s association with the world of orphans came through Themesha, who used to tutor them at Lakehaven Children\\'s Home. \"One day I substituted for her. The experience was euphoric and I began tutoring children there in maths and physics.\" He was then invited to join the organisation\\'s residential standing committee - and the rest is history. Khan has watched the world of child welfare go through its own historic timeline. \"There always seems to be a new need. Around the World Cup, sex trafficking was the issue. Today it\\'s whoonga. Sometimes street children between the ages of 8 and 16 are addicts.\" But there are success stories too, like that of the five A matriculant last year, who is now studying accountancy on a bursary. He arrived at Child Welfare as a street kid. \"Although we would like to take credit, I think it might have been internal,\" he said. \"We just gave him the support needed to flourish.\" Once they turn 18, orphans are no longer entitled to the sanctuary of children\\'s homes and successful individuals can enter society. This is a hard call for people without much in the way of support structures. In an effort to overcome this problem, Child Welfare is running a pilot project this year, offering a transitional home to support youths, aged between 18 and 23, who have potential to succeed at tertiary level. Child Welfare also tries to link |up its children, who leave their care and enter adulthood, with other |organisations. \"I like synergies and partnerships. NGOs need to work together, with government and corporates,\" says Khan. \"A lot more can be achieved to reunite children with their families,\" he says. \"Reunification is important to us. It\\'s part of the national policy. The idea is not to have children growing up in an orphanage.\" But these successes happen at a cost to Child Welfare. \"For every child we reintegrate, we lose a subsidy. This is part of the process that is understood and accepted by us and sadly society has children to take up these vacancies.\"\n",

      "It\\'s a Saturday morning and a group of final-year law students from the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) are being introduced to the coal face of homelessness. They are at the Denis Hurley Centre at the invitation of director Raymond Perrier, one of the founders of the National Homeless Network (NHN). They will start creating relationships with people who many barely notice, let alone consider to be worthy of human rights. They gather in groups and start engaging with a couple of homeless people, hearing about their lives on the streets, how they ended up there and how they survive in this often brutal world. It\\'s a touch in-your-face: a young woman reaches for something in her back pocket and pulls out a syringe she uses for drug taking. A young man talks about his love for writing. \"Thank you so much for listening to me,\" he says afterwards. Interactions between homeless people and those who enjoy a roof over their heads may involve asking for money or food, but centre director Xoliswa Jwili believes simply being heard is highly significant. While many people may be unwilling to barely acknowledge them as fellow human beings during brief traffic-light and pavement interactions, security officers and law enforcers are known to take that attitude to a different extreme. For this reason, a network of a dozen organisations working with homeless people in every major city in South Africa - NGOs, faith-based organisations and academic institutions - has used the week of Human Rights Day to ask the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to initiate an investigation into the systematic human rights abuses experienced by homeless citizens at the hands of security officers. \"Between us, we interact with tens of thousands of homeless men and women daily, providing them with access to nutrition, sanitation, shelter, health care, counselling, rehabilitation, training and employment. \"We are thus well informed about the reality of their lives and the indignities they suffer,\" the letter to the SAHRC states, adding that it wanted to reinforce the message that homeless rights are human rights. The National Homeless Network includes Towers of Hope in Bloemfontein; The Haven Night Shelter in Cape Town; U-Turn in Cape Town; the Denis Hurley Centre and i-Care in Durban; JOSH in Joburg; MES in Joburg and Ekurhuleni and the Tshwane Leadership Forum in Pretoria. Among the homeless folk who had experience of this is Phathumusa \"Pat\" Khumalo who now owns and runs a second-hand book business at the KZNSA Art Gallery in Glenwood, initiated by the Denis Hurley Centre\\'s Street Lit initiative. \"I have seen a lot of violence. People stabbing each other, getting killed. Brutality of municipal police towards the homeless. I have had my belongings taken away from me. My matric certificate. My ID book,\" he recalled. Back at the centre, Jwili advised the law students to be on their toes when talking about law with some of the homeless. \"Many of them read a lot and know exactly what is going on in the world.\" Khumalo says there is also a down-side to this: \"If you\\'re well-read and educated, yet homeless and out on the streets, it\\'s usually a good idea to keep your background under wraps. Sometimes you appear to be too clever,\" recalling his existence when drug abuse derailed his law studies. He said it was wise to surrender to the tall poppy syndrome for the sake of relations with fellow homeless people, police and people living normal lives. \"People do anything to bash you down,\" he said. When it came to law-enforcement, authorities were likely to pick on someone who may \"know more than us\". \"They\\'ll abuse you the most.\" Then, when the public hear the accent of a homeless person who appears to be educated, they are curious about what happened to land them there. \"All they do is listen to your story and then go and tell it to other people.\" Khumalo did most of his drug taking while he was working and had a roof over his head, in Cape Town in the restaurant sector and as a court interpreter in KwaZulu-Natal. He found himself on the streets after his family in Vryheid became less supportive towards him when he returned to his roots. He had already abandoned a drug rehabilitation programme in Durban. Always an avid reader, he said reading proved a wonderful escape from life as a homeless person.\n",

      "Indian cricket is in trouble. Of that there is no doubt. For many years, fortress India was something impregnable when it came to Test cricket. Teams travelled there knowing conditions on and off the field would make winning a Test series a tough proposition. Much has changed. Team India find themselves taking an awful hammering from England and have no answer to anything thrown at them. Their bowling cupboard is thread-bare and with Sachin Tendulkar holding a spot on reputation, it\\'s sad. While he scratches and scrapes together an innings in the hope of one more glory moment for his country, the situation worsens. Clearly, his time has come. The predicament the coach and selection panel will feel is such an icon needs to go in his own time. He has earned that right but, at some point, his closest friends and confidants need to suggest he moves along. Ricky Ponting suffered that fate. All great players eventually do. The performance by England captain Alistair Cook has been something of a fairy tale. No captain has ever taken to scoring runs like him since taking up the reins. Not only is he raking up the numbers, but so are his top order batsmen. Andrew Strauss must be smarting that fortunes at the top of the game have turned so rapidly. Kevin Pietersen seems back in the fold and once again, that winning feeling is making for a happy camp. Not so here in Durban. From all accounts, the cat is among the pigeons as players\\' rumblings take hold. The Dolphins\\' season has been tough, as is to be expected when matches are affected by rain, and the pressure to win mounts. A period that has seen more rain since the start of the season than is the norm in an entire year, was never going to help matters. Looking at the statistics, though, the critical areas are quite obvious. The middle order, which is where the results in one-day cricket are often decided, hasn\\'t delivered enough. Vaughn van Jaarsveld has been outstanding, but David Miller has clearly not been able to play the role of match winner frequently enough. Also, the number three spot has been problematic. Too often, the Dolphins have got themselves into a really good position, only to squander the opportunity. However, after all is said and done, the process toward regaining ground lost over the last few years has begun, and it will take time to rebuild. It is definitely not an overnight process. Cool heads and cricketing knowledge are needed. Something else I find interesting is the appointment of Russel Domingo, the current assistant coach to Gary Kirsten, to the position of head coach of the T20 set-up. What it means is that CSA have bought into the idea that one coach cannot do everything and the splitting up of the post is the way to go. In one way, I cannot fault it, but on the other hand, Gary Kirsten still overseeing the entire process just means he is no longer at the coal face on the day. Right now, we are the number one Test team, but are off the pace in the shorter versions of the game. Isn\\'t that where he should be focusing and bringing our rankings up? Winning a world trophy is something that has eluded South Africa and that\\'s what I would want to do next. Good old Joe Public wants it too. The T20 team is an unsettled one and urgently needs some TLC. It just seems the wrong way around to do things. The Kiwis arrive shortly for the series here and are beset with all kinds of issues. Not least of which is that Ross Taylor, their best batsman, and Daniel Vettori, have pulled up the ladder. A new captain and some inexperienced players are going to find the going tough here. They would do well to start practising against the short ball as the only decent drive they may see is in the bus on the way to the ground in the morning.\n",

      "I recently read with great disappointment reports in the media that the Magistrates Commission confirmed that Stanley Gumede is facing \"various\" complaints against him which are being probed by the commission. In our view, this is a deliberate effort to turn a magistrate into a dartboard, which brings the justice system into disrepute. The Judicial Code of Conduct provides that \"Implementation and accountability requires that institutions and procedures established to implement the code of conduct must do so, to strengthen public confidence in the judiciary, thereby to reinforcing judicial independence which shall take into account the legitimate need of the judicial officer to be afforded protection from vexatious and unsubstantiated accusations, and due process of law in the resolution of complaints against a judicial officer.\" This code was adopted in the Bangalore conference in 2002 and South Africa was party to the conference. The Magistrates Commission has to make a clean break and apprise the public as to how long it takes to investigate complaints lodged against a magistrate. This is in direct conflict with the international standard in terms of implementation and accountability with respect to the Judicial Code of Conduct. The investigation, we are informed, dates back many years. The commission fails to explain the number of years it has taken to investigate the case. It also fails to explain the reasons why the investigation has not been finalised. The commission is clearly in violation of the principles of our constitution, which endorses the principle that every citizen is entitled to a speedy hearing, as justice delayed is as good as justice denied. The commission, in our view failed to protect the office of the magistracy and judicial ethics in South Africa. The Committee of Senior Judges, chaired by Mr Justice of Appeals Louis Harms in 2002, stated that \"The supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law are fundamental to the democracy established by the constitution\". To fulfil that constitutional role, the judiciary needs public acceptance of its moral authority and integrity, which is the real source of its power. Accordingly, the constitution commands all organs of state to assist and protect the independence, impartiality, dignity, accessibility and effectiveness of the judiciary. Failure to give dates of receipt of complaints and the reasons for the delay in finalising the investigation, takes away a golden opportunity to render a balanced and unbiased perspective of the criticism. There is, to some of us, a view that the issue of investigation surfaces each time there is a suggestion that Mr Gumede is under consideration for upward mobility or elevation within the justice system. This view which is denting the image and the integrity of the magistracy and Mr Gumede, has its origin in a series of events. Firstly, years ago when then-KwaZulu-Natal regional court president Mr Hamilton Cele, was appointed as a Labour Court judge, talk in the legal circles within the province was that Mr Gumede, purely on the basis of his legal acumen, would make a suitable successor, but the ugly rumour of investigation surfaced. Immediately after the appointment of an acting magistrate, the rumour of investigation disappeared only to reappear when the post was subsequently advertised. The rumour again disappeared immediately after the permanent president of the regional court magistrate was appointed. This unfortunate situation has now re-emerged solely because Mr Gumede is being considered for appointment as national director of public prosecution. It appears that this has become a pattern to deny the South African public the benefit of being served by Mr Gumede, who is a jurist famous for his independent thinking, with great foresight, brilliant, hard-working and unwaveringly uncompromising upon issues of principle, policy and constitution. He is one of the few magistrates that is always timeously in court and ready to proceed with matters immediately, sometimes to our disappointment as attorneys and prosecutors. There are no efforts to finalise charges or remove Mr Gumede as a regional court magistrate but these investigations disqualify him from being director of public prosecution. This presupposes that the regional court magistrate is less important. This view contradicts the view expressed by the late Chief Justice I Mahomed when he said \"the coal face of justice is in the magistrates courts\". It is our humble submission that the action of investigating a judicial officer endlessly does not uphold and promote the good name, dignity and esteem of the office of the magistrate and the administration of justice. The actions of the commission are contrary to paragraph 9 of the code of conduct: judicial ethics, which provide that \"A magistrate refrains from discussing, remarking or commenting on matters pertaining to the profession, with the media or in public in a manner which is detrimental to the image of the office of the magistrate\". While one may not comment much on the merits or demerits of the complaints, however, the mere fact that Mr Gumede has been allowed to preside over cases as a regional court magistrate for so many years, suggest that either: (i) The complaints do not have substance and therefore should have been dismissed. (ii) The complaints are not serious enough to warrant immediate finalisation and/or removal. (iii) Possibly, the complaints are just kept to be used as a political bargain to keep a good judicial officer from progressing within the justice system. There is however, a danger to the independence of the judiciary because though judicial officers are accountable, their accountability does not extend to them having to account to another institution for their judgments. One can only hope that the commission is mindful of the fact that the independence and impartiality of the magistrate requires that the decisions of the magistrates should not be the subject of any revision outside the appeal or review procedures as provided by the law. Otherwise, the independence of the judiciary is endangered by those who are supposed to guard it. Section 372 (3) of the code requires that complaints against judges that are directly related to the merits of a decision or procedural ruling must be dismissed at the outset. In Petition of Lauer 788F2d 135 8th Circuit 1985 the point is well made that while many people may agree or disagree with the sentence and the judge\\'s reasons for imposing the sentence, it must be remembered that a judge has the authority and the power to be wrong as well as right - dissatisfied litigants or other citizens should not be able to influence a judge about a judicial decision through the threat of disciplinary sanction. Members of the legal fraternity in the province confirm and assert that they hold Mr Gumede in high esteem. He holds B Juris, LLB degrees and additional qualifications from Cambridge and Liverpool universities. Mr Gumede rose within the ranks of the justice system. He started his career as a clerk of the court in 1986, court interpreter, and a prosecutor and control prosecutor. He was appointed as a district magistrate from 1990 to 2001 and was promoted to be a regional court magistrate in October 2001. A regional court magistrate can sentence a person to a life sentence in certain circumstances and now has civil court jurisdiction. He has also lectured at the University of Zululand. As is evident from the above, Mr Gumede is more than qualified for the position of director of public prosecution. It is our humble submission that Mr Gumede is a fit and a proper person and adequately qualified to be appointed as a high court judge not to mention head of public prosecution.

      "DURBAN\\'s once-thriving K9 police unit has gone to the dogs. So say 43 of 70 police officers in the unit, who have signed a petition calling for the removal of their commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Phillip Rajah, who is accused of running the unit into the ground. In addition to fighting crime on the streets, the Durban Central SAPS Dog Unit is in charge of sweeping public spaces and national key points, including King Shaka International Airport, for explosives and drugs. Now its members claim that the unit has systematically degenerated since Rajah took over the unit in 2010, and morale is currently at an all-time low. It has been left paralysed, with patrol dogs that are too old and due for boarding, as well as a car fleet that has shrunk from 25 to just four. \"Morale is so low you have captains saying: \\'We\\'ve only got three years to go - we\\'re just looking after our retirement.\\' It\\'s a sad situation.\" Rajah has declined to respond to the allegations, citing police protocol. Among the issues raised in a formal grievance form lodged in December, the unit\\'s members say that: l Despite being at the coal face of fighting crime, members have not been to the shooting range in more than three years. Why is this the case? l Bulletproof vests have not been changed every five years, as required by law. l They are not allowed to work overtime, despite there being a budget for it. l The unit\\'s car fleet has come down from 25 to a paltry four - including two Renault Koleos, which aren\\'t equipped with dog kennels and can\\'t chase after criminals fleeing in high-performance cars. l Some of the dogs are too old, or have been injured in incidents and ought to be boarded and replaced with new ones. l Two R5 rifles are in a state of disrepair, with pins missing. l Whereas each monthly lecture used to be accompanied by a fitness assessment, this is no longer happening since Rajah\\'s arrival. \"We\\'ve gone for specialised training in explosives, dog handling, narcotics detection, advanced driving, but the thanks you get is a bad car which is not serviced and has smooth tyres,\" said a member of the unit, who spoke to the Sunday Tribune on condition of anonymity. \"We used to be the top dog unit in the province in terms of statistics for arrests, recoveries of vehicles and firearms. Now we are ranked fifth. \"We\\'re responsible for national key points... We carry a lot of responsibility - we\\'re proud to be dog handlers and to serve our country. But our ability to do our jobs is severely compromised. \"We have nothing personal against our commander, but if he can\\'t do the job, then he should step aside and the job must be given to someone else.\" The aggrieved members handed in their grievance letter in December and are upset that nothing has been done to address their concerns. When approached for comment, Rajah said: \"Unfortunately, I can\\'t speak to you, boss. You know the protocol involved. Speak to the (police) media centre.\" Provincial police spokesman Colonel Jay Naicker said the grievance procedure in the SAPS was an internal mechanism. \"The section head, K9 and Mounted Unit, Colonel Mdlalose, has been tasked to deal with the grievance, and we are awaiting the outcome of her investigation.\" He said Mdlalose was a seasoned officer from the K9 environment and well-equipped to make an informed finding. With regard to the management of overtime funds, Naicker said members could be called up to perform overtime duties as and when the need arose, but they could not ignore the prescripts of the Public Finance Management Act. However, they would endeavour to make overtime available, if so required. Naicker said once a vehicle was boarded from service, it was removed from the SAPS database and could not be repaired or serviced. \"The dog unit has 22 vehicles currently, and will be required to undergo regular and scheduled repairs and maintenance. Vehicles that are damaged will also be required to undergo repairs sometimes for long periods, depending on the nature of the damage.\" He was confident the unit had sufficient vehicles to ensure service delivery was not compromised. In the meantime, the provincial fleet manager confirmed he was expecting six new high-performance vehicles for the unit any day. Regarding training, Naicker said that members of the unit, like all other K9 units, were sent on refresher courses as and when they became available. \"New members for the unit have also been identified and sent for courses at the SAPS K9 Academy in Pretoria. \"With regard to shooting practice, members are called up for regular shoots like all other SAPS members, but their commander has indicated that certain members do not pitch up at these shoots. He has been instructed to deal decisively with such individuals.\" He said all police dogs were taken care of by the state vet, and only the state vet could make a final decision as to when a dog may be boarded. The two R5 rifles had been damaged through fair wear and tear, and had been repaired. The replacement of bulletproof vests was being attended to by provincial supply chain management. Monthly fitness lectures had been affected by renovations at the unit, but they were continuing at other venues.\n",

      "South Africa\\'s economy has been bombarded with strikes, especially in the mining sector (gold, platinum and now coal). Unions are at the coalface demanding astronomical pay increases, citing inflation as the main reason. A demand for 10.5 percent is normally shunned with contempt. Yet our politicians and executives at state-owned enterprises are always in line for above-inflation pay increases. Hlaudi Motsoeneng, the SABC\\'s chief operating officer, received |an increase of 60 percent in one year. No institution, be it private or public, is immune to the ravages of inflation. Why, therefore, are our tertiary institutions - Wits, UCT and Rhodes - being bombarded with \"wildcat\" student protest action against a proposed rise in student fees? Violence has again reared its ugly head. It has become the unspoken and new language seemingly understood by those in authority. We are treading a dangerous path. A reticent, tired-looking Blade Nzimande (Minister of Higher Education) responded: \"We\\'ve never said that education must be free. Those who can afford to pay must pay. We are not the first port of call. Each place of higher education is autonomous.\" Yet management at all of these institutions are pointing fingers at the government which should have granted more student loan funding as a means to alleviate their on-going fee problem. Finally, when one enters a tertiary institute, there are contractual obligations between the institution and the student. One of the obligations should be that there will be an annual inflationary increase in fees. If one cannot afford the fees, why enrol to study at a place of higher education? Many of us in our heyday (siblings, relatives, friends) were denied such higher studies due to poverty. We had to resort to seeking employment after basic schooling and through sheer hard work, determination and part-time, self-funded study we achieved our dreams (albeit delayed). No jobs? Ask one of our many foreigners for an idea as to how to secure some form of employment. But be prepared to work hard and honestly. Entitlement and immediate gratification: therein lies the problem.

      "THE corporate world can be a scary place. Nobody knows that better than KwaZulu-Natal-based business development coach and stress therapist Virginie Nothard, whose career path has taken twists and turns over the years. \"I don\\'t say all the experiences I have had mentoring and coaching in the business world have been without their problems and pressures. But I have learned that the only way to understand the complex dynamics of human beings and the way they handle the jobs they do, is to have been there at the coal face.\" Her experience includes working with multinationals like HSBC Bank, Rio Tinto, British Petroleum and Unilever. It\\'s this experience, gained over years in the coaching, training and recruitment in South Africa and overseas, that has created a solid foundation for starting her own leadership agency, with its own set of bespoke strategies aimed at overcoming stress in the workplace and, in turn, making people\\'s personal life more harmonious. It\\'s easy to see her MauritianFrench-style passion and entrepreneurial flair are signature parts of this mission which, in short, she says, is to make people more confident and better able to cope with the hectic pace of modern globalised business. The explosion of new internet technologies, fierce competition and the drive to make higher profits are all part of the enormous pressures that today\\'s corporate leaders face, she says. \"Because of those factors the job of mentoring and coaching is a hugely complex task requiring a whole new set of rare skills.\" More than the qualifications required to secure a post, she says, leadership coaching in today\\'s fast moving world is about how a person adapts to the demands of the work and gets the best response from people at all levels. \"The only way to get to grips with that broader picture is to understand how a person\\'s mind works and to introduce a number of different mind mechanisms and options to smooth the way for a more successful outcome.\" An important element of that broader picture, she says, is following up the progress of people who have been placed in top jobs. \"It is only when a person has been hired for the job that the real demands and pressures begin. For me, being part of that adjustment and transition is not only rewarding, it becomes an ongoing part of my own research. I always say to people we are in this together, both learning as we go along.\" At that point the term \"disruptive thinking\" comes into play. Nothard explains disruptive technology as a global concept that focuses on innovative disruption embracing what is known as the fourth Industrial Revolution and the nurturing of a new way of thinking. \"The idea is that changing the way people think can nurture a new revolution in innovation from start-ups to global enterprises. It\\'s about turning what you thought was right, on its head. It\\'s this concept that almost anything can be accomplished.\" A brief journey into the world of quantum physics is the next chapter in this fascinating insight into New Age business, which Nothard believes will one day be the norm. \"We are talking about how the neurons produce energy within the brain, something that neuro-scientists are only now beginning to understand. We know that the way neurons fire and the positive and negative energy they produce are not cast in stone and can be altered.\" Let\\'s look at an example where this thinking could be applicable. \"Let\\'s imagine,\" says Nothard \"that a powerful CEO is such a stickler for numerous detailed reports that he puts his staff on edge, which in turn causes jitters and psychological stress, which then effects productivity and increases stay-aways. If this negative repetitive behaviour can be re-energised in a positive way using a different neural pathway in the brain, the outcome could be far more acceptable.\" Nothard, Standard Bank winner of the 2008 entrepreneurial mom of the year award and the 2017 Hirsch women of the year winner for August, is a co-founder with Angelique Thompson of the DisruptHR Durban chapter. Her plans are to host a conference in KZN aimed at introducing the \"disruptive\" idea into the work place. \"This approach to recruitment and mentoring is so new in South Africa\", she says. \"We need to know more about it from the people in this field. We need to create a different lens, understand the massive mental and mind-shift involved. It\\'s about massive and radical change.\" Nothard is volunteering her coaching skills to InvoTech an innovation and technology business incubator supported by the Durban University of Technology and funded by the Small Enterprise Development Agency. lizclarke4@gmail.com Disruptive innovation, a term coined by behaviourist Clayton Christensen, describes a process by which a product or service takes root initially in simple applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves up market, eventually displacing established competitors. As companies tend to innovate faster than their customers\\' needs evolve, most organisations end up producing products or services that are too sophisticated, expensive and complicated for many customers in their market. Companies pursue these \"sustaining innovations\" at the higher tiers of their markets because this is what has historically helped them succeed: by charging the highest prices to their most demanding and sophisticated customers at the top of the market, companies will achieve the greatest profitability. However, by doing so, companies unwittingly open the door to \"disruptive innovations\" at the bottom of the market. An innovation that is disruptive allows a new population of consumers at the bottom of a market access to a product or service that was accessible only to consumers with a lot of money or a lot of skill.

      "At the the beginning of every South African academic year the same concerns are raised by teachers and parents; too many learners, too few teachers, overcrowded classrooms, too few resources and lack of infrastructure. The situation, according to most educators, is getting worse. What has to change? Basically everything, believe those who are trying to revolutionise the way that learners and those entering the tertiary sector are taught. In short, say this new breed of learning innovators, you not only have to think out of the box, you have to invent a new box - a digital one that may incorporate artificial intelligence or one that finds a way to dramatically improve the quality of teaching. When you have a class of only 10 matrics and they all fail, you know something has gone wrong. When you have substantially more boys than girls sitting for their final exams, you know the system is not working. Many of those advocating radical changes are teachers already at the coal face dealing with what they say are \"insurmountable\" odds. Among them is long-serving Western Cape teacher and advocate of change, Maryke Bailey who in a recent interview said that overcrowding in the classrooms remains a number one issue with teachers struggling to deliver effective lessons to over 50-60 children. \"We are failing our children in terms of resources and class sizes, but the problem is bigger than that. There is a teaching crisis in South Africa. We are not producing teacher excellence across the board, and lack of resources and the overcrowding just add to the problem. \"We have to come up with creative ways in which teachers can teach effectively even in adverse conditions.\" Stellenbosch-based professor Patrick Bean, executive dean of STADIO Faculty of Education and Humanities\\' School of Education (formerly Embury), believes that one way to improve the quality of education is to embrace the rapid development of technology and connectivity around the world and use distance learning as an educational tool. \"The main goal of introducing technology into education must be to level the playing fields - making education accessible to everybody, beyond the geographical and/or wealth barriers.\" The idea is not falling on deaf ears. President Cyril Ramaphosa\\'s ambitious target to ensure that every school child in the country has access to a tablet with digital workbooks and textbooks within the next six years could be the starting point together with his introduction of compulsory early childhood education. \"We will start with those schools that have been historically most disadvantaged and are located in the poorest communities,\" he said. Some may see the tablet idea as putting the cart before the horse. Others, like Bean, see it as the beginning of a home-grown digital learning revolution.

      "There are few things more disgraceful than an organisation representing doctors playing politics when South Africa is grappling with a deadly virus and literally fighting for the survival of its people. It was nothing short of despicable to watch the national chairperson of the South African Medical Association (Sama), Dr Angelique Coetzee, criticising the government for requesting assistance from specialist Cuban doctors and health-care professionals when other developed countries such as Italy, Spain and many others around the world have been requesting all the help they can get from the experienced Cubans. Cuba has medical brigades in 61 countries, and is assisting governments in 23 in fighting Covid-19 by deploying further medical brigades. In her interview on eNCA, Coetzee gave away the real agenda behind Sama creating a storm when she said, \"Cuban doctors are being caught up in this political drama that is now playing.\" It is a political drama of Sama\\'s making, as it is upset that the government did not consult the association before bringing in doctors from Cuba. Sama is pushing for retired South African doctors to be paid by the national government to go back into service, rather than the government recruiting experts who have had remarkable success in combating Covid-19. What is even more disturbing is that the Sama chairperson, speaking on behalf of 16000 South African doctors, does not seem aware of Cuba\\'s expertise in the treatment of HIV and tuberculosis. \"South Africa has the highest HIV and TB rate in the world, which the Cubans don\\'t have,\" Coetzee said. Cuba is considered one of the leading nations in the treatment of both HIV/Aids and TB, and many of its doctors have been on the ground in South Africa treating those exact diseases since 1994. South Africa has learnt from Cuba\\'s successes on both fronts, and striven to emulate its prevention programmes. In June 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised Cuba as the first country in the world to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV/Aids and syphilis as public health problems. Cuba was also one of the first countries in Latin America to roll out HIV prevention and treatment programmes, and to provide free antiretroviral therapy to all its citizens with HIV. In 2015, 92% of HIV patients in Cuba were receiving dedicated care, and the country had a network of 230labs testing for the disease. Cuba\\'s HIV/Aids infection rates are among the lowest in the world due to their health promotion and primary care, and the country has even produced five generic medicines for the disease. As for TB, Cuba aims to be the first country in Latin America to eliminate TB according to the WHO plan, and has managed to get cases of TB down to 6.2 per 100000 when the rest of the continent stands at 25 cases per 100000. Cuba has also improved technologies to ensure the rapid and timely diagnosis of TB. But Coetzee seems to think that Cuban doctors may not understand the burden of HIV/Aids and TB in South Africa. Cuba\\'s 451 community-based polyclinics are the main pillar of its health-care system, and its health-care workers are familiar with local problems like a lack of water and electricity, which are also prevalent in South Africa. The Cuban embassy has confirmed that the Cuban medical brigade now in South Africa had already attended to 5500 patients in isolation areas, hospitals and red zones prior to coming to the country. Coetzee\\'s other statements exposed her arrogance and short-sightedness, when she said, \"We have things under control... We don\\'t need experts outside the country to tell us what to do... People coming in are not going to the coal face.\" But even countries with the most sophisticated health systems are acknowledging that in the face of Covid-19 they need Cuba\\'s help. If one listened to the press conference by Minister of Health Zweli Mkize on where the Cuban doctors and specialists would be deployed, they will be assisting at the coal face. What is most relevant is that Cuban doctors will be putting their lives on the line to treat and save South Africans. If one reads the testimonials of Chinese doctors and nurses in Wuhan at the height of the pandemic, one would get a glimpse into the absolute horror involved in watching patients dying on the floors of hospitals gasping for breath, and the doctors and nurses having emotional breakdowns, and becoming infected themselves. No Cuban doctor is being paid enough to justify putting their lives and mental health on the line for this mission. And, importantly, it is the Cuban government that is paying their salaries while here. South Africa is providing transportation, accommodation and food, which amounts to R440 million for the duration of their stay. But they are not here for the money, they are here as an act of solidarity in a time of crisis. As the Cuban embassy said this week, they derive their inspiration from Che Guevara, who said, \"The life of a single human being is worth a million times more than all the property of the richest man on earth.\" As South Africans we need to push back against the immoral campaign of the Trump administration which is threatening governments that welcome the presence of Cuban doctors to their shores. The smear campaign is immoral and a crime, as it seeks to deprive the right to health care to many around the world that Cuban doctors could assist. The US has not been able to effectively deal with Covid-19, and has not been in a position to assist less developed countries in their fight against the pandemic. There are no US doctors being deployed around the world to assist countries with weak health systems. The fact that Cuba has made its limited resources available to send its medical professionals abroad to this extent, is a hugely generous feat, particularly since it has been under a suffocating economic blockade for more than 60 years. Unfortunately, the DA in the Western Cape was initially aligning themselves with the Trump administration\\'s position on Cuba and was averse to the arrival of the doctors. The reason was because the DA disagrees with communism. The party has since relented given the rapid rise in infections in the province, and a contingent of Cuban health workers has been deployed there. It would be prudent for the national chairperson of Sama to show some humility, humanity, and appreciation for the huge sacrifice that Cuban doctors are about to make in our country, and stop playing political games when we are all in a fight for our lives.\n",

When the scandal broke last year, Cosatu\\'s Zwelinzima Vavi and Mark Heywood of advocacy group Section 27, were the only ones calling for the head of the minister.The voice of the teacher union was very loud in its silence and suggested complicity with the status quo. Sadtu members are the ones who have to be at the coal face of every education crisis.Due to a lot of politicking, however, Sadtu steered clear of taking a principled stand and making their opinions known.Perhaps at the time they thought speaking out was not going to earn them any favours with their employer, the minister.More than a year later, Sadtu\\'s call to fire Motshekga sounds like cheap posturing and is highly baffling. The timing of this call for Motshekga to be fired is not convincing but highly reactive because the members are now feeling threatened.The union is said to be angry after the minister failed to consult their members when she withdrew the agreement that protected collective bargaining for teachers. They are also incensed by her plans to put biometric devices at schools to monitor their working hours.Clearly when it comes to looking after their own interests, Sadtu can mobilise into a formidable opposition as we have seen them take to the streets if their salary demands are not met.Why is it that we do not hear their loud voices on important matters that affect learning and teaching in schools?Issues such as performance of pupils, safety in schools, the rise in teenage pregnancy plus the lack of resources that still see some pupils being taught under trees which equally affect Sadtu members.These are the ills that all partners from teachers, parents to policy makers must fight for at all times if our education system is to have a chance at improving.\n",

But it was open season for gangsters and hoodlums who controlled it from their backyards. Fixed fights were the order of the day. Fighters would hop from one province to another under assumed names and brawls would drag on for more than 20 rounds.There was neither a punishment index nor rules. Boxing was a gamblers paradise.•LEGISLATIONHorrified by this ungainly spectacle, the national government passed the infamous Act 39 of 1954, to curb these misbehaviours.The idea was to reign in the cowboys and mischief-makers who controlled the sport.The government embarked on a programme to control the excesses of the sport and to protect boxers from charlatans.By passing legislation penalising those taking part in unsanctioned fights, the safety and livelihoods of the boxers became the focus.•THE ROLE OF SPONSORSHIP IN BOXINGSponsorship is the lifeblood of all sports activities.The recent TV blackout of boxing by SABC had a negative impact on the sport.One of the unintended consequences was the exodus of sponsors from the fight game.But the recent return of live boxing to SABC TV and radio offers a glimmer of hope.It offers vast opportunities for marketing and advertisement.But BSA should assist all small promoters, who still lack business acumen. They should try to link them with like-minded business people.It is BSA\\'s duty to match development promoters with top level business people.TV has the innate potential to discharge massive revenue streams for BSA and every stakeholder in the business.•WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR BOXING UNDER GOVERNMENTAct 39 of 1954 was promulgated to weed out unsavoury aspects of the sport.This Act was an attempt to protect the boxer from scavenging elements posing as promoters and agents.It was meant to stop feuding elements and reduce conflict among competing tendencies, discourage coercive practices and thereby create uniform rules for every player in the industry.But it was later done away with when BSA\\'s Act 11 of 2011 came into the fore.Nothing much has changed on the coal face of the sport. Promotional agreements between boxer and promoter remain largely unregulated.BSA needs to take control of this aspect of the game.The current act and its regulations provide enough scope and to allow BSA to advance the cause of boxing. The private sector can be enticed, encouraged and even cajoled to assist the development of boxing.I am a fundamental conservative who believes BSA in conjunction with the private sector can best leverage opportunities for all stakeholders, including managers, trainers, boxers and promoters.Boxing is a fantastic sport, imbued by compelling drama and theatre.It has the ability to capture the imagination of millions of people worldwide.For all intents and purposes, this presentation should be seen as some form of bulwark against the intrusion of wholly free market-based practices into the sport of boxing.The galvanisation of boxing rests on the three pillars of safety, health and protection of boxers from scavengers.I am convinced there will always be a need for a regulator to safeguard these interests.HOOKED: Mzonke Fana (right) takes a stab at Xolisani Ndongeni.

      "Corrupt municipal officials will be caught because the law enforcement agencies are ready to deal with graft, acting local government minister Nathi Mthethwa warned yesterday (Tuesday). \"We would like to warn those who are involved in corruption and those who are planning to get involved that they will be caught,\" said Mthethwa. He was speaking during the first day of the SA Local Government Association (Salga) conference at Durban\\'s Inkosi Albert Luthuli convention centre. Mthethwa, who is also Minister of Police, urged councillors to fight corruption without fear, saying the police were more than ready to arrest the culprits. Mthethwa told delegates it was an undeniable truth that some municipalities faced problems of corruption, weak financial management and weak ability to deliver services. \"We need to decisively deal with corruption without fear or favour. Corruption is an ill that has to be removed from our midst as it serves to deny citizens what they rightfully expect from government,\" he said. The cost of corruption was huge on poor people and would have disastrous consequences if it was not addressed. \"The public rating of councils is very low. We can\\'t just ignore such perceptions. We need to work together to strengthen the capacity of our municipalities so that they can deliver.\" The local government sphere was perceived to be incompetent, disorganised and riddled with corruption and maladministration, Mthethwa said. According to the pamphlets distributed at the conference, corruption in the public sector, local government and the private sector risks failure in the delivery of services and compromises relations between citizens and the state. It was important that municipalities performed maximally because they were at the coal face of service delivery, he said. \"We need to make the sphere of local government a pleasant one. It is a sphere where a person (councillor) has to be a minister of everything. When people are angry, they direct their anger at them (councillors),\" he said. Local government faced major challenges such as the reduction of unemployment, more access to better quality basic services and strengthening community participation. \"The priorities in the elections manifesto are not mere promises aimed at attracting votes, only to be shelved after the elections. These priorities must become our point of reference and the living reality for all the people.\" eThekwini municipality mayor, James Nxumalo, said it was important for Salga to coach struggling municipalities. \"Improving the capacity of municipalities is very important because people are becoming impatient.\" New Salga leaders are expected to be elected during the conference.\n",

      "How the premiers of the nine provinces performed in their role in 2023 provides an insight into how successful they have been in addressing critical public issues and where they have made mistakes and failed to deliver on their promises. This can help identify areas for improvement in 2024. The yardstick for premiers: are our provinces in steady hands? Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane (Passop:) If there\\'s anything that the Mpumalanga province has managed to do well, it\\'s the ability to separate party politics from the business of government - at least in the eyes of the public. While Mandla Ndlovu was elected provincial ANC chairperson in April 2022, he expressed no ambitions to replace Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane as premier, who came into office in March 2018. On the governance side, Mtsweni-Tsipane had a lukewarm time in office, because her government failed to deliver basic services, mainly to informal settlements lacking ablution facilities, resulting in residents forced to relieve themselves in the veld because the government has not provided the needed infrastructure and basic services. The situation persists, with some municipalities failing to spend their conditional grants on infrastructure development and maintenance. Nomusa Dube-Ncube (Passop:) When an ANC group known as the Talibans endorsed KwaZulu-Natal Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube, she made a dramatic return to the top echelons of politics. The ANC\\'s grouping, which named itself after the Afghanistan Islamic fundamentalist group that returned to power in 2021, made a clean sweep at last year\\'s ANC KZN provincial conference, electing firebrand leader Bheki Mtolo as party secretary and Siboniso Duma as chairperson. Dube-Ncube had been on an opposing slate when she was brought in. It later dawned she was beholden to the grouping and had to toe their line. Due to the frequent dominance of Duma, the MEC for economic development, tourism, and environmental affairs, would be evaluating her one-year term in office. At a key government event, Duma would act as premier, stealing the limelight away from Dube-Ncube. A memorable stunt pulled by Duma on Dube-Ncube was during the national rugby team victory parade in Durban, imposing himself and lifting the Webb Ellis trophy, with Eben Etzebeth reducing the premier to a spectator. Zamani Saul (Playmaker:) Northern Cape Premier Zamani Saul is celebrated in his province as one of the leading intellectuals. His fan club proudly calls him \"Doctor\", celebrating that he holds a Doctor of Laws in public law and jurisprudence. On the front, Saul could be credited with making education fashionable, especially in the ANC, where sloganeering could catapult anyone to a top post. The only stain in Saul\\'s government relates to his private life. A plus for Saul is that he takes seriously issues of potential corruption when they are brought to his attention. That level of urgency and responsiveness is what SA needs, including in the central government. Alan Winde (Passop:) The DA\\'s public relations machinery has spared no effort to portray the Western Cape as an island of exemplary governance in South Africa. Where Premier Alan Winde cannot demonstrate real change in people\\'s lives, he whips out big numbers on current and future investments made in communities - like a tick-box exercise. Although statistics can give a general idea of what\\'s going on, it is critical to remember that they hide a lot of detail. Winde needs to focus on meaningful change. Governing should be about creating meaningful policies that benefit ordinary citizens rather than scoring political points. Winde and the DA should focus on results that regular people can see and feel. Only then can they be truly successful. Just as a reminder, Winde, South Africa is a unitary state, not a federal one. The stunt you pulled on Putin\\'s arrest should never again happen. Bushy Maape (Early shower:) North-West Premier Bushy Maape came into office as a stop-gap candidate to bring political stability to the troubled provincial government. The success of his tenure relied on political maturity. Under his leadership, there has been no identifiable squabbles. For the most of 2023, Maape was on sick leave, leaving the ANC provincial chairperson and human settlements MEC Nono Maloyi in charge in an acting capacity. Maloyi wasted no time stamping his authority, giving momentum to Maape\\'s service delivery programmes such as \"Thuntsa Lerole\", a Setswana phrase meaning \"hard at work\". But faced with years of dilapidated infrastructure that was hardly maintained, it would take more effort for the North- West province to be restored to its former glory days. For a pensioner, Maape did his best under the circumstances. The province now needs new blood. Oscar Mabuyane (Playmaker:) The unemployment rate in the Eastern Cape province has been slashed and is on a decline from 47.9 % in the fourth quarter of 2020 to the current 38.8 % in the third quarter of 2023 under Mabuyane\\'s stewardship. Since coming to office in 2019 in the sixth administration, Mabuyane\\'s provincial government has reduced unemployment by 9.1 %. Infrastructure development has also been the mainstay of Mabuyane\\'s government, with multiple major projects rolled out. This is a good move because it positions the largely rural province as a possible place for investment by foreign and domestic investors, which will help alleviate poverty and create jobs. Whichever direction one enters the Eastern Cape, the province is a construction site, particularly on roads. Rail and port infrastructure has also proved an area of growth, with the provincial government partnering with Transnet and positioning the Eastern Cape to offer a solution to the country\\'s logistic challenges. Mabuyane has also invested effective time in the education space, which has been the Achilles heel for most of his predecessors. There has been a consistent increase in the matric pass rate from 68.1 % in 2020 to 73 % in 2021 and 77.3 % in 2022, indicating that the province\\'s education system is on the right track. In health, the Mabuyane government has seen the life expectancy of the province improve from 54 years to 66 years, while maternal and child mortality rates have also dropped. Panyaza Lesufi (Playmaker:) Arguably the best premier among the current crop, if not ever, Lesufi has proved that with hard work and dedication, any government can achieve anything it sets its sights on. With just a little over a year in the position, Lesufi has done so much that one would be forgiven to assume he has been at it since the start of the sixth administration in 2019. The beauty of Lesufi\\'s energy and hard work is that his provincial cabinet members have had no choice but to join the moving train. The work ethic and morale across the provincial government are on an unprecedented high. Thanks to Lesufi, employment is the order of the day. His Nas\\'iSpani campaign of 6 000 jobs every month has been the real game-changer. For the first time in history, Gauteng now has crime wardens who have come in handy to lessen the burden on members of the SA Police Service. Communities that have not had power for three years or more due to damaged transformers, will have lights this Christmas because of Lesufi\\'s efforts. State-of-the-art face recognition cameras are being installed in the province, another big win in the crime-fighting strategy. Stan Mathabatha (Playmaker:) After ringing changes in his provincial cabinet last year, many were expecting chaos in the provincial government, but Mathabatha has shown his experience by leading a stable government. Mathabatha\\'s biggest bragging rights this year are getting to the negotiation table with his Gauteng counterpart, Lesufi, to discuss the construction of a railway line between the two provinces. This was a big move for many reasons, but chiefly to alleviate the permanently heavy traffic on the road between the two provinces. But once completed and fully implemented, this project will serve as a model for other provinces, such as KwaZulu-Natal, which has an excessive number of heavy-duty trucks on the road. As the cherry on top, Mathabatha finished the year on a high by providing 57 vehicles to traditional leaders in Limpopo. This will make it easy for the chiefs who are at the coal face of community problems to move around with ease, providing solutions for their communities. Whoever becomes president is spoilt for choice for ministers with leaders of Mathabatha\\'s quality - scandal free.\n",

      "Eskom has moved to calm critics of its preferential pricing deals by confirming it is renegotiating long-term contracts with an aluminium producer and a mining house. The announcement this week that the electricity utility had two customers on special deals through which they paid less for energy than other industries and consumers, erupted in a row: Cosatu threatening to mobilise its members and the Cape Chamber of Commerce called for a full investigation into the so-called sweetheart deals. The deals were shrouded in secrecy and apparently not disclosed to the National Energy Regulator when Eskom applied for its three-year, 35 percent increase. Eskom officials had told Parliament that its key industrial customers paid lower rates for electricity through special agreements, but that details of these contracts were confidential. Andrew Etzinger, Eskom spokesman, told The Sunday Independent that contrary to recent speculation the utility did not have special contracts in place for all of its 138 large industrial customers. Only two customers, who hold four contracts between them, were still on special pricing agreement contracts. While Etzinger would not name the companies, it was understood that one was BHP Billiton which has contracts for its aluminium smelters at Hillside, Bayside and Mozal in Mozambique, and the other Anglo American for its Skorpion zinc mine in Namibia. The long-term pricing agreements, said Etzinger, were currently under review. Negotiations between the companies and Eskom had started at the end of 2009, shortly after an undertaking by the utility to renegotiate long-term pricing agreements as the country continued to struggle to meet energy demands. He said that at the time of entering into the special agreements, the country had abundant electricity. It was when a concerted effort was being made to attract new industries to South Africa. \"In terms of the aluminium industry, it is common practice internationally for them to enter into long-term agreements with power utilities because the risk of the investment is so large in terms of electricity pricing. So they need surety before they can invest. \"The single-year price determination structure in which the price was decided yearly was in place at the time and did not provide enough surety. They needed greater insight to determine what their investment was likely to yield,\" he said. The multi-year price determinations which give more certainty were only introduced after these deals had been signed. The negotiations, he said, could take some time as this was a \"very complex issue that will require extensive negotiation\". Mamphela Ramphele, chairman of the Technology Innovation Agency, last week wrote in The Sunday Independent that the continuation of the scandalous late apartheid-era multi-decade special pricing agreements amounted to exporting South Africa\\'s precious energy resources to Australia and other destinations where shareholders were benefiting from the cheap electricity fuelling their investments here. \"Such pricing arrangements allow for multinational mining companies like BHP Billiton to import aluminium from Australia and smelt it in South Africa where they use our ridiculously cheap electricity before they re-export it back to Australia for use in various products. In this process South Africa suffers a double loss: precious electricity extracted from burning our finite coal, and industrial development through beneficiation,\" she wrote. Etzinger said other large industrial customers were on the MegaFlex plan. They were charged according to time of use which differed between winter and summer. If a customer was far from the grid, using electricity during winter at the evening peak, they would be charged R1.40 a kilowatt hour. On the opposite end of the scale, if the client was close to the grid and using electricity off-peak in summer the charge would be 14.7c per kWh. In addition MegaFlex and NightSave customers paid fixed transmission and distribution network charges for capacity used, electrification and rural subsidies, a service fee and an administration fee.\n",

      "Sister Arwen - she of the defiantly alternative lifestyle - has a severely practical side. Thus, when Winnie Madikizela-Mandela allegedly flipped her lid this week with virulent attacks on everyone from her ex to the Arch, Arwen promptly identified this as the result of media exposure deprivation (that\\'s MED, not MAD, by the way, though the symptoms are somewhat similar). If only darling Winnie had consulted her, Arwen said, she could have provided lessons (at a price) in media management... so much more elegant than \"spin doctoring\", don\\'t you think? \"Look at how \\'Little Julie\\' manages his media profile,\" she murmured. \"Drip, drip, drip wears the stone away.\" (I think she was referring to the heart of my editor, as he imposes ever-earlier deadlines.) \"He doesn\\'t slag off Gwede Mantashe and Vavi Zwelinzima on the same day that he\\'s calling for the nationalisation of Breitling watches and Moët champagne.\" Instead, she noted, \"an issue a day keeps Julie in play\". Facing keen competition from \"The Mouth\" Madikizela-Mandela, the ID\\'s Patricia de Lille decided to remain her usual shy and retiring self, leaving it to sidekick Lance Greyling to ask the World Bank to hold back on the R29 billion loan Eskom wants. That is, until ANC front company Chancellor House pulls out of Hitachi Power Africa, which has the tenders to build the Medupi coal-fired power station and the proposed Kusile station. (Greyling is believed to be either the only other member of the ID apart from \"Thin Lips\" de Lille, or a remote-controlled avatar.) My advice: if Eskom needs money that badly, why doesn\\'t it just borrow from \"Little Julie\"? Then the ANC can pick up its R1bn profit from Chancellor House as the gravy train goes round and round. If \"Thin Lips\" really needs a new bandwagon, she could join the eco-bunnies in their attempts to sabotage our natural, cheap source of power - coal - and demand that we move to hugely unreliable wind/ solar sources. This would have all sorts of interesting results, including cutting employment almost as much as would a nationalised mining industry, a recent pet theme of \"Little Julie\". Then \"Thin Lips\" would have yet more to complain about, without, of course, taking any responsibility (cause and effect not being in many politicians\\' repertoire). Non-pols like you and I, dear reader, concerned more with real-life jobs and ever-rising power bills, can check a recent analysis of the \"greening\" of Spain, which has headed the same way as Germany in a bid to appease tree-huggers. Boffins at Madrid\\'s King Juan Carlos University found that for every \"green\" job flowing from solar subsidies, rather more than two jobs in other sectors were destroyed. All this after the equivalent of R5.56 million had been poured into the creation of each \"green\" job. (As you\\'d expect, Germany was a tad more efficient, spending \"only\" the equivalent of R1.7m to generate each \"green\" job. But I won\\'t hazard a guess at just how far we could go in the other direction if we really, really tried, while allowing the tenderpreneurs and deployees to skim off their percentages.) One final thought about Winnie \"the Mouth\": she was in Alabama, of all places, that quintessential southern state, when the ANC finally thought to contact her to check if she had indeed been \"correctly quoted\". Why there? Clearly because luscious Liza Minnelli got it so right in the song My Mammy, with the lines \"Everything seems lovely, When you start to roam\", but then, as always with Winnie, confusion took over and \"My heart strings a tangle around, Alabama-ammy\". \"Vader Jacob\" Zuma\\'s splendiferous state visit to the former colonial power has already borne fruit. After the topics over which the London gutter press attacked him, it seems appropriate that the first quantifiable goodie should come in the form of aid to buy 42 million condoms before the World Cup. Understandably, \"Vader Jacob\" was concerned about the needs of soccer fans visiting our fair shores for the first time, but I\\'m sorry that the Brits could only see their way to providing this limited quantity, when in fact a total of 1 billion condoms were asked for. Let\\'s hope that he zinged the poncy Poms in the same way that allegedly happened during one of the Allied conferences towards the end of World War II, when Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill used to get together to consider carving up the post-war world. Supposedly, Marshal Joe Stalin used the impending advance of the mighty Red Army into the German heartland to make a special request to US President Franklin D Roosevelt: could the next lot of US aid include about 10 million condoms to protect Stalin\\'s gallant troops from fascist diseases as they \"fraternised\" their way to Berlin. FDR enquired what size the Soviets would prefer, to which Stalin came back: \"The 30cm ones will be adequate, Comrade President.\" Without missing a beat, FDR turned to an aide and said: \"Make a note: 10 million Texas Mediums for our allies.\" I\\'m no great admirer of the two-wheeled wonder, Lance Armstrong. But I like even less the poverty of spirit displayed by presenters and callers alike on a talk radio station this week, chirping about how Armstrong was held up at Cape Town International Airport on Monday night because his passport didn\\'t have enough blank pages. Stuck in limbo, Armstrong tweeted about the hold-up, before finally reporting: \"Well, made it into SA. Not the friendliest welcome I\\'ve ever received but we\\'ve all seen immigration officers like that.\" The sheer nastiness of those on the phone-in show was sad, with mingled envy and hatred added to a sort of \"Who does he think he is\" whinge, plus a dash of \"That\\'ll show the Yanks\". Yes, roolz is roolz, or as the Nazis used to say: \"Ordnung muss sein!\" and \"Befehl ist Befehl!\" to excuse any and all nastiness. Surely in the great scheme of things, cluttered pages in an otherwise valid passport are pretty minor, worthy of \"You\\'ll know next time. Meanwhile, let\\'s see what we can do to get emergency papers. And, by the way, welcome to South Africa.\" In the country of \"maak \\'n plan\", let\\'s stay positive, friendly and helpful. If we don\\'t, many of those hoped-for hordes of soccer fans, for example, are going to leave sadly disappointed.\n",

      "It might take 30 to 60 days to clear a backlog following the end of a strike that had crippled exports of metals, wine and fruit, Transnet said on Friday. The SA Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) signed an agreement on Thursday with state-owned Transnet for an 11 percent wage increase and a one-off payment of 1 percent of workers\\' salaries. The deal had added R1 billion to Transnet\\'s wage bill, the company said. \"We\\'ve estimated it will take between 30 and 60 days to clear the backlog,\" Transnet spokesman Mboniso Sigonyela said on Friday. The strike, which started on May 10, forced several companies including Exxaro Resources, ArcelorMittal South Africa, and Xstrata to declare force majeure on metal and coal deliveries, enabling them to miss contracted deliveries. It has cost the country billions of rand, according to the SA Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Most of Satawu\\'s members employed by Transnet had returned to work on Friday, the labour group\\'s general secretary Zenzo Mahlangu said. \"I can say with authority the majority of workers are back to work and are working very hard,\" Mahlangu said. \"By Monday everybody will be back,\" he said. AP Moller-Maersk, some of whose ships had been moored offshore while they waited for the strike to end, would take \"several weeks\" to clear the backlog, spokesman Fred Jacobs said on Friday. Maersk and other shipping lines are charging exporters extra to deliver delayed goods. The country\\'s fruit industry has suffered R1 billion in losses owing to the labour action, according to Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Tina Joemat-Pettersson. South Africa, which produces fruits ranging from grapefruit to plums, is the world\\'s second- largest citrus fruit exporter after Spain. It was \"too early\" to calculate losses at Transnet, Sigonyela said. - Bloomberg\n",

      "As many dedicated couch potatoes have perhaps noticed there has been a reshuffle in DStv\\'s channel line-up to accommodate future channels. Ordinarily this would perk me up but given that one of the world\\'s biggest sporting events is about to kick off (pun intended) in this country, I am inclined to believe that these mystery future channels will be dedicated to covering and unpacking all the ups and downs of the World Cup. It\\'s hard to forget that this event is almost upon us, what with the panoply of flags festooning almost every nook and cranny of Joburg and the reverberations of vuvuzelas you can hear well into the night. It\\'s a hard instrument to play and requires extensive practice to perfect. It\\'s a bit late to be introducing a soccer channel, especially given that legions of footie fans are about to descend on our cities. We could have done with a TV series preparing us for the event. You see, while everyone and their dog has been writing up guides to South African cities and our peculiar patois and mannerisms, there isn\\'t any material that might help locals deal with the influx of so many pesky tourists. It takes a certain kind of patience and sense of humour to deal with folk who arrive in our country harbouring all kinds of misconceptions. Before the World Cup is out, we might be wishing some bright spark had written a book titled A Dummies\\' Guide to Tourists in Africa. Most of us have over the years encountered these kinds of visitors; they are easy to spot at the airport decked in their khaki outfits as they prepare to launch into their own fantasy Out of Africa experience a la Karen Blixen\\'s novel or, conversely, what I call \"Bono\\'s starving-impoverished-bring-a-tear-to-your-eye African adventure\", where visitors get to play the benevolent, empathetic saviours of humankind. Celebrities looking for ways to banish guilty feelings for being paid obscene amounts of dosh for diddly-squat tend to opt for the second African adventure. We know more about the cultures in Europe and America than they do about ours, what with most of television products hailing from those countries. But perhaps the best way to get under the skin of another culture is to view its members in the context of a foreign society - their perception of difference and how such notions define their identity. For this reason, all those British travel shows - of which there seem to be an obscene number on our tellies - featuring the likes of Louis Theroux, Stephen Fry and Paul Merton, are more enlightening of their personalities and worldviews than the places they visit. Of the three it is Fry I find the most endearing. His skew nose very much sums up the manner in which he wears his imperfections on his sleeve. Not that that is unusual for a Brit; they are a terribly self-deprecating bunch who are more at ease criticising themselves than parading around like proud peacocks - like the Yanks. But one should not mistake a Brit\\'s humility as any indication as to how they view their (elevated) position in the world. Although Fry, in his show Stephen Fry In America (BBC Knowledge), appears pretty down to earth, he cannot surrender the notion that he is viewing the world from a position of privilege. It\\'s not just his hoity-toity upper-class accent that gives him the edge. Even in a scene where he goes down a coal mine it is clear that he is there as a curious voyeur and the focus is on how Fry views the experience, rather than what it might be like for those who spend their working lives in those dark subterranean parts. He holds onto his Britishness and what that represents so tightly it prevents him from really experiencing the new environments and cultures he encounters. Really, it\\'s absurd that he does his road trip in America in a black cab. This type of vehicle might be a stereotypical emblem of British culture but it\\'s not really appropriate for long journeys. Besides, isn\\'t doing a road trip around America just a convenient excuse to snap up and drive a cheap, flashy convertible? Fry is also averse to sunshine, thus he speeds through all the sunny cities where beach culture rules, such as Miami. So while he gives the impression that he is up for anything, like checking out a garden where forensic scientists watch human corpses decompose, he only gets involved in quirky activities that conform with this notion of himself as an eccentric and humorous British raconteur. Nevertheless, Fry makes a much better travelling companion than some of his crabby contemporaries, such as Merton, who is so weighed down by cynicism that you wonder why he ever left home at all. Even when Merton finds himself taking a bath in beer on the German leg of his trip he wears a pained expression. Like Fry\\'s series, Merton also hunts down the more quirky attractions in Europe. During a trip to Milan in his Paul Merton in Europe (BBC Knowledge) series he meets a footballer who lives in a clothing store and an unconventional shoemaker who makes art with naked women. Preference for these offbeat attractions gives a skewed view of the continent, establishing it as one full of oddballs. Always with a sardonic comment at the ready, Merton hardly revels in the company of the weirdos he encounters; their enthusiasm cannot penetrate his cool detachment. I suppose the idea is that like most well-travelled Brits, he has seen it all and thus isn\\'t fazed by anything, no matter how preposterous. I wonder what he would make of groups of men wearing makarapas?\n",

      "It\\'s serenely silent as I hike down the canyon walls. The only sounds are the crunch of my boots on the boulders, the occasional twitter of a bird and the gentle tumbling of the river. High above, towering orange cliffs loom, outlined against the deep blue sky. It\\'s a hot morning, so I stop for a swim. The cold water refreshes me instantly and I linger, soothing my muscles. Our group is spread out and I hike on alone, feeling small and insignificant in this vast space. Namibia\\'s Fish River Canyon is a harsh and beautiful place. Purported to be the second largest of its kind in the world after the Grand Canyon in the US, it measures approximately 160km in length, stretching southwards from Seeheim to the Orange River. The five- or six-day hike that penetrates its base is strenuous, winding through 85km of jaw-dropping scenery from the Hobas viewpoint to the spa resort at Ai-Ais. There is no defined path to follow - trailists have to clamber over boulders, climb embankments and trudge through thick sand or across open plains. There\\'s also no set route - using the map as a guide, you simply follow the river. Furthermore, you need to find the short cuts; if you don\\'t, you\\'ll add many hours of hard slogging to the journey. Nights are spent beneath the stars, with groups finding a flat sandy space and rolling out their sleeping bags. You carry your backpack for five days, so it\\'s vital to be well prepared with the barest essentials. Mine included sachets of tuna, cracker biscuits, instant soup and pasta meals, powdered energy drinks, energy bars and a spare gas canister. Instant oats with raisins and honey would do for breakfast, and I added several slabs of Lindt chocolate. Clothing consisted of a few T-shirts, two pairs each of shorts and underwear, a jersey, a sunhat, a beanie, a sarong and tracksuit pants. My biggest problem was my camera gear, which totals 4kg. After squeezing in cooking equipment, medical supplies, a sleeping bag and an inflatable mattress, I was shocked to find that my pack weighed a hefty 23kg. I became ruthless. Out came half my clothing, a few packets of soup, some energy bars and my lens. The weight registered about 18kg. The chocolate stayed. I wake before dawn and leave Cape Town as a violent thunderstorm breaks over the city. I fetch fellow hiker Julian Abramson and we head along the N7 towards Namibia. Just past Springbok the clouds disperse to reveal a bright, sunny day. At the border we negotiate customs with little fuss, and drive across the Orange River. The sun has just set when we arrive at Ai-Ais, where we rendezvous with the other hikers in our party. Everyone is excited and, after a barbecue, we soak in the hot spring water and chat about our forthcoming adventure. The next morning we take the shuttle bus to Hobas, where we pose on the edge of the canyon for the obligatory team photograph. I slap on some sunscreen, do a few stretches and heave on my pack. We descend the precarious path cautiously, negotiating the rocks with care and using the chains secured at the steeper sections. It\\'s very hot. Unaccustomed to the heavy backpack, my hips are hurting like hell. After two knee-jarring hours I reach the river, strip off my clothes and plunge into the water. Lunch is tuna with crackers, a square of cheese and an energy bar. \"Your pack is now about 250g lighter,\" jokes Abramson. We take a short siesta, then walk in the afternoon heat along the stone-strewn banks of the river. The canyon is so still that the silence is deafening. \"This place is amazing,\" he smiles. \"I sat for a moment and it was so quiet that I could hear the insects talking.\" I trudge on slowly through thick sand and over big boulders, stopping every hour for a swim, until the light softens and we reach a wide sandy bank. I ease the load off my aching back and level out a stretch of sand, then unroll my mattress and sleeping bag. The sun sets and a thin band of pink cloud colours the sky. Dinner is leftover steak and sausages from our barbecue last night, followed by rooibos tea with whisky and honey. Before scrambling into my sleeping bag, I rub my limbs with arnica oil to soothe my sore muscles. Despite being tired, I\\'m entranced by the twinkling stars and dark heavens, and fall asleep lulled by the river gurgling and murmuring around the rocks. Day Two dawns cloudy and after a quick cup of tea we set off downriver. The conditions are ideal for hiking and some of the speedsters in our group rush ahead, leaving us dawdling behind, stopping to swim and take photographs. The first two days are spent covering what is considered to be the most rugged part of the trail as it involves plenty of boulder-hopping and plodding through thick sand. Finding that the left bank has become too steep to negotiate, we make the first of many river crossings. One slip could mean a dunk in the river or even broken bones. I walk on alone, enjoying the silence. Suddenly, amid the barren scenery, white lilies bloom from the earth. Fragile footprints of insects and lizards pattern the sand. The ascending sun illuminates the orange cliffs, then appears overhead, glinting on the green water. After two hours we stop for breakfast and Abramson fires up the Cadac cooker to boil some water. Instant oats have never tasted so good. Trekking on, the going becomes tough as we struggle across long stretches of giant boulders and soft sand. We soon learn to read the canyon by watching the curves of the gorge ahead. I fall into the so-called \"Fish River rhythm\" and the hours fly past. The birdlife is plentiful and we watch two grey herons swoop over the river, their cries echoing off the canyon walls. A booted eagle glides gracefully on the thermals, then suddenly flies off in a frenzy. \"It\\'s being chased by a kestrel that probably has a nest in the area and is protecting its chicks,\" says Meidad Goren, the team\\'s birding expert. Hours later, we stop at a small rocky cove for lunch: chicken noodle soup, tuna with oven-dried tomatoes and a herb dressing, with the usual crackers. By late afternoon we still have not caught up with the frontrunners, and we decide to make camp on a wide beach. I wake early the next morning and check my boots for scorpions before pulling them on. Two of our party set off to try to catch the others. We linger over breakfast until the sun strikes the upper canyon walls. I wash the cutlery with sand and water, then heave on my backpack. It definitely feels lighter today. Soon we encounter the stench of sulphur at Palm Springs, where boiling water gushes from the earth. We spend an hour soaking our limbs, but cannot linger too long or we will fall even further behind. Abramson and I trek on past Klipspringer Ridge and as the peaks of the canyon turn gold, we\\'re treated to the majestic sight of three wild horses drinking from the river. We also spot a large monitor lizard before it vanishes under a rock. The sun disappears and we find a perfect site to spend the night. While collecting firewood, we see three of our companions walking on the opposite riverbank. \"We crossed a little way back but it\\'s too deep here for us to come back over,\" they shout. \"We\\'ll camp further down and meet up with you tomorrow.\" Abramson lights the fire and we relax. \"It doesn\\'t get much better than this,\" he says. \"We\\'re sitting beside a crackling fire, under a starry sky, next to a flowing river, with the horses nearby and pasta cooking on the coals. This is paradise.\" We rendezvous with the others in the morning and find a short cut before scrambling down to yet another river crossing. Shadows creep across the folds of the canyon as the sun lights up the land. We pass Dassie Ridge, then negotiate a series of boulder fields and a vast rocky plain. At last, after a tiring 10-hour slog, we camp below towering Four Finger Rock. After dinner we sit around the fire, toasting marshmallows and listening to the distant cries of baboons and jackals. It\\'s the last day and our small group wakes long before sunrise. We still have 25km of hard hiking ahead to reach Ai-Ais by evening and my feet are taking strain. I\\'ve got four big blisters and every step is agony. Nevertheless, as the sun\\'s rays touch Four Finger Rock, we\\'re ready to go. At a tricky river crossing, a few members of our group slip on the rocks. My blisters are really killing me. Others are also suffering and every break turns into a communal first-aid session. I shut my mind to the pain and hike on doggedly. We finally stumble onto the last short cut at 3pm. There\\'s still 12km to go, but we\\'re on the home stretch and I allow my thoughts to turn to the comforts awaiting us at Ai-Ais - clean clothes, a steak, a cold beer. Crossing the river for the final time, I hobble on for the last few kilometres until, as the light softens and the rocks glow gold, we round a corner and spot the campsite. We dump our packs, order beers and jump into the spa\\'s hot water. Our aches and pains are soon forgotten and we pledge to return to this wilderness of water and stone.\n",

      "Squabbles in the mining industry last year put controversial regulatory issues under the spotlight. And, partly as a result of the problems that emerged, foreign investors with long-term plans largely steered clear of South Africa. Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Indonesia and Malaysia were magnets for foreign direct investment (FDI) last year while South Africa nearly fell off the map. Nazmeera Moola, a director at Macquarie First South, believes the country\\'s failure to compete with other emerging markets is largely due to two factors: South Africa lacks a large internal market and its domestic demand is sluggish, compared to some of the larger emerging markets. And investment in resources - the country\\'s major attraction - has been affected by concerns about security of tenure and infrastructure constraints. Against this backdrop, South Africa lost out to its emerging market peers last year. The UN Conference on Trade and Development reported last week that FDI to emerging markets as a whole rose 10 percent to $524.8 billion (R3.7 trillion). South African\\'s share was a miserable $1.3bn as FDI plunged nearly 78 percent. In comparison, Brazil attracted more than $30bn; Chile $18.2bn; Mexico $19bn; Indonesia $12.8bn; and Malaysia $7bn. And it is not just the country\\'s FDI performance that reflects problems in the mining industry. Leon Esterhuizen, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, says South Africa\\'s mining stocks are trading at bigger and bigger discounts to their peer groups. \"And it\\'s not an Africa issue but a South Africa issue,\" he says. \"Mining companies in Ghana, Mali and other countries in West Africa are |trading at a premium to North American mining stocks, but South African companies are trading at a discount.\" Calls by the ANC Youth League\\'s Julius Malema to |nationalise the mines set the tone for the year. But other factors were equally problematic. Esterhuizen cited regulatory uncertainty, escalating power costs and strikes. Roger Baxter, the economist at the Chamber of Mines, says it is difficult for mines to develop new projects because power supply is limited. The mining sector failed to get the most out of the commodity boom, which peaked in mid-2008, because electricity producer Eskom was unable to meet the country\\'s needs. After halting production for several days in January that year, mines were restricted to 90 percent of normal usage for several months. Baxter says many companies had to restructure in 2008, closing down shafts that have never been reopened. Lack of adequate transport is another barrier to investment. Mike SchÃ¼ssler, the chief economist at Economists.co.za, says the problem is particularly acute in the case of bulk commodities like coal. \"Richards Bay can handle 90 million tons of coal a year but Transnet will only be able to achieve that quantum in a few years time.\" Road transport is an expensive alternative, he says. So companies have to absorb extra costs when they can\\'t move their commodities by rail. South Africa\\'s mining industry has been in a state of flux for several years. Major changes came in 2003 with the conversion of old order mining rights to new order rights. But Moola says the change in itself was not a problem. It simply brought South Africa into line with \"international practice\". The problem she says was that it took the then Department of Minerals and Energy several years to process the applications. And investors were only prepared to invest once the transfer was completed. Moreover, \"the way the law was written, a lot was left to the discretion of officials, which created uncertainty\", Moola says. \"Companies thought they had rights and it turned out they didn\\'t.\" Peter Leon, an expert on mining law at attorneys Webber Wentzel, believes Susan Shabangu, Minister of Mineral Resources, is making a determined attempt to deal with the issues of concern. In September, she imposed a six-month moratorium on licences for prospecting, to allow for an audit of licences granted and to develop a new licence process tracking system. Meanwhile, amendments to legislation to clarify the situation are expected this year. But the outcome remains to be seen. In the meantime, investors are left with perceptions that political connectivity is an important factor in striking deals. Transactions that made headlines last year include a high profile deal which involved President Jacob Zuma\\'s son, Duduzane Zuma. Commodity prices started recovering in March 2009, after the 2008 crash in global financial markets. But South Africa\\'s mining response was tentative. After falling by 5.6 percent in 2008, the mining component of gross domestic product (GDP) fell 4.2 percent the following year. However, things are now looking up. In November, mining GDP increased 9.6 percent year-on-year, according to Statistics SA, from 6.5 percent in October. The turning point came in June, after a year-on-year decline of 7.7 percent in the 12 months to May. Perhaps the investment outlook will improve this year - particularly if the regulatory issues are resolved and highly connected businessmen are no longer seen as the first in the queue.\n",

      "South Africa\\'s dependence on the car for transport would be among the government\\'s major challenges as it attempted to wean the economy off fossil fuels, Sir David King, a former scientific adviser to the British government, said on a visit to the country this week. The South African-born academic, who set up and directs Oxford University\\'s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, warned that a combination of peaking oil production capacity and global economic recovery would send oil prices surging to a point where the economies of non-oil producing countries would again falter. \"We\\'ve had a global financial crisis - and I\\'m one of those who believe the global financial crisis was stimulated by the very high oil price of 2007 and 2008 of $150 (R1 053.04) a barrel - followed by a debt crisis... I think we\\'re going to see a second spiral of a global economic downturn,\" he said. \"We\\'ve got all sorts of reasons to move quickly and to think out of the box in terms of how we defossilise our economies. And South Africa has quite a long way to go.\" King, who advises the government of Rwanda and about 100 large international companies on climate change, said South Africa\\'s growth as a \"very high-carbon economy\" with per capita emissions equivalent to those of the UK was due in part to the influx of people into megacities like Johannesburg and Pretoria \"where getting around on foot or bicycle isn\\'t really possible\". As a result, South Africans spent a lot of time in traffic jams or took the choice to arrive at work early. King believed the way forward was to \"rethink our style of living - go right back to square one\". He welcomed the extension of the country\\'s mass transit system, including a high-speed rail link between Johannesburg and Pretoria. A key issue for South Africa would be putting a price on carbon - in the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, he said. The Treasury last month released a discussion paper in which it expressed preference for a modestly-rising carbon tax up to R200 per ton of carbon, although it acknowledged a tax would not set a ceiling for carbon emissions in the short term. It listed a number of concerns with implementing a carbon trading scheme. King said while taxes and cap-and-trade schemes were financially equivalent, a trading scheme with caps |that were \"not sufficiently screwed down\" would not cause the technological switch required for a low-carbon growth trajectory. \"In Britain, the government is now thinking about introducing a carbon tax to supplement the carbon trading products, so that we can put a floor on the carbon price. I think that\\'s absolutely the right way forward,\" said King, who was the head of chemistry at Cambridge University before being appointed the UK government\\'s chief scientific adviser a decade ago. In South Africa, the Treasury\\'s recent carbon tax discussion paper listed a number of concerns with implementing a trading scheme, including the \"oligopolistic structure\" of the local energy sector, which would limit domestic trade in the scheme, lead to inappropriate permit prices and possibly act as a barrier to entry for newcomers. King suggested a trading scheme that brought other southern African nations on board as a solution, but acknowledged that the absence of a unified political system - like that which underpins the EU\\'s emissions trading scheme - would be a hindrance. \"So either you introduce trading between provinces in South Africa, and that may not be feasible, or you go for a tax. And the tax is going to be a much simpler system,\" he said. The selection of the form of carbon tax to implement would be a \"very big question\". The Treasury\\'s discussion paper says an upstream proxy carbon tax would be relatively easy to implement, although a proxy tax on fuel inputs could be considered and levied according to the carbon content of fossil fuels. King said a tax at source was probably more practical, but cautioned: \"The danger is you\\'re simply passing the cost on to the consumer of electricity - whereas if you tax by estimating the carbon content of manufactured goods and so on, you\\'re on much stronger ground. \"But it may also be more difficult for the government to implement... How do you distinguish a manufactured article in terms of whether it\\'s used electricity from hydropower to one manufactured using electricity from coal?\" King advised that countries wait for the lifetime of their high-carbon, large-scale infrastructure facilities to play through as they transitioned to low-carbon modern technology. \"It has to be managed by taking it step by step. Anything that is done should not be done overnight. This is something that can only be done over a period of decades,\" he said.\n",

      "The utilisation of production capacity for November 2010 was 81.6 percent compared with 79.9 percent in November 2009, an increase of 1.7 percentage points. This improvement can mainly be attributed to a decrease in insufficient demand by 1.6 percentage points. The year-on-year decrease in insufficient demand indicates further improvement from the slowdown in the economy that started towards the end of 2008 and was experienced through most of 2009. The manufacturing divisions that reported the largest year-on-year gains in November 2010, were motor vehicles, parts, accessories and other transport equipment division with a contribution of 10 percentage points; electrical machinery division with 3.8 percentage points; wood and wood products, paper publishing and printing division with 2.3 percentage points; basic iron and steel, non-ferrous metal products and metal products and machinery division contributing 1.9 percentage points; and furniture and \\'other\\' manufacturing division, which includes recycling and tobacco products with a contribution of 1.2 percentage points. There were four manufacturing divisions where year-on-year decreases were also prevalent. Of these, the biggest decrease was in the glass and non-metallic mineral products division with |-2.7 percentage points. The decrease in this manufacturing division follows a similar trend to the one observed in the Building Statistics Survey. Other divisions that also reported marked year-on-year declines in utilisation rates include the food and beverages division a -0.7 percentage point and the radio, television and communication apparatus and professional equipment division with a -0.6 percentage point. The declines in these two divisions correlate closely with the production and sales survey. With regard to the annual rate of utilisation of production capacity in the manufacturing industry, comparing the November 2010 utilisation of production capacity figure with August 2010, an increase of 2 percentage points was evident. However, this increase can be attributed more to seasonal factors as November is usually the peak month of the year for manufacturers. More importantly, the increase had inherent base effects, thus marking a recovery from the strike in the automobile industry in August 2010. Electricity generated and available for distribution shows a year-on-year increase of 1.1 percent in actual consumption of electricity in December 2010. For the year 2010, the increase was 3.8 percent compared with 2009, which followed on a decrease of 2.7 percent between 2008 and 2009. Electricity consumption data is a robust indicator of the performance of the manufacturing industry because of the intensive dependence that manufacturing has on electricity, especially the iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical and petrochemical and non-metallic minerals division. According to the latest data available from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa, the manufacturing industry consumes about 38 percent of total electricity available for distribution in South Africa. Data on electricity generation also gives insights into mining production and sales data, specifically coal production data. About 92 percent of South Africa\\'s power is generated by means of coal-fired power stations, therefore there is a high correlation between electricity generation and coal production data. This week I will be releasing the Manufacturing: Production and sales for December 2010, which will be published on Thursday. Furthermore, on Wednesday I will be releasing the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) for the fourth quarter 2010. Pali Lehohla is the statistician-general and the head of Statistics SA\n",

      "Transnet\\'s inability to transport the country\\'s expected maize surplus of 2 million tons due to inadequate rail infrastructure has resulted in a staggering loss of R3.3 billion in potential business for the local grain industry. AndrÃ© Jooste, a senior manager for marketing and economic research at the National Agricultural Marketing Council, said on Friday that the situation in the grain industry was not optimal as the country was unable to export maize to its traditional markets in neighbouring states because they had produced sufficient quantities themselves. He added that if South Africa had produced a surplus over an extended period, it was important to plan how to move goods from one place to the next. \"It\\'s a pity that Transnet can\\'t face the demands.\" He explained that the current situation favoured food security in South Africa and food prices would move to export parity, which would make things less expensive. The challenge was to get to an optimal situation where exports and imports were balanced, he said. Bloomberg reported that South Africa could become Africa\\'s biggest agricultural exporter if there were adequate transport and shipping facilities. \"The country would need to export 350 000 tons of maize a month between May and September,\" the report said. Bloomberg said that white maize was currently trading at R1 627 a ton and yellow maize at R1 679. The lost opportunity for grain producers mirrors the problems facing the coal sector, which is losing export business because of limitations on the Richards Bay coal line. Business Report reported earlier last week that the Richards Bay Coal Terminal\\'s plans for increased export volumes would be put on ice until 2015 because of limited rail infrastructure from Transnet. This has resulted in the coal industry missing out on higher demand from Asian markets. Sandile Simelane, the spokesman for Transnet Freight Rail (TFR), which transports grain for both domestic and export markets, said TFR engaged with the grain industry regularly through a number of initiatives, and also provided customers with regular feedback. \"TFR management also has regular meetings with various grain-related bodies to discuss strategy. This is to ensure that we provide the best service,\" Simelane said. He said that during the past year TFR transported 3.2 million tons of grain, and of that amount 150 000 tons was transported to the Southern African Development Community countries for the same period. TFR, through its capital expenditure programme and quantum leap strategy, was embarking on \"a huge spending spree\" to address challenges across the board. \"This is meant to improve our services to all the commodities. We are also doing our best to optimise the available capacity to rail more tonnages in all the commodities.\" He would not be drawn on how much Transnet was losing in business opportunities due to inadequate transport infrastructure. \"Transnet will soon be announcing its financial statements and the company\\'s plans going forward. More information will be shared then,\" he said, after being asked what strategy the company had to satisfy coal and grain demands. He explained that grain was usually single wagon traffic and not block traffic like coal. It was much easier to execute block load traffic than single wagon traffic, which needed numerous shunts before it ran on a general train to the destination. Coal did not have a higher priority than grain, except that coal, in block loads, was much easier to execute. Lourie Bosman, the DA shadow minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said if the grain industry could produce a surplus, then it was imperative to get into the market. He also expressed concern about the limited facilities that were available to move the grain once a market had been established. Bosman said a solution would be to allow the sector to get into the bio-fuel market, insisting that there was enough land to expand production.\n",

      "The ANC\\'s commitment to armed struggle and the formation of its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, presented Tutu with a tricky dilemma. He abhorred violence. The whole thrust of his prophetic ministry was to campaign and plead for the abandonment of apartheid so as to avoid the racial bloodbath he believed would otherwise engulf his beloved South Africa. Yet he never decried the ANC\\'s armed struggle. This was necessary to retain credibility among the militant youth to whom he was trying to give leadership and guidance. But this was not just an opportunistic attempt to wriggle out of a tight corner. Tutu genuinely believed in, and was able to justify theologically, the principle of a just war in the face of intolerable oppression. \"I will never tell someone to pick up a gun,\" he once said in an attempt to explain the ambiguity of his position, \"but I will pray for the man who picks up the gun, pray that he will be less cruel than he might otherwise have been, because he is a member of the community.\" Careful though he was, it inevitably meant once again that he sailed close to the wind, stopping just short of inviting the capital charge of treason. But, ironically, it was among the militant \"comrades\" that Tutu ran into the most vehement criticism for his position on violence. For all his intellectualising of the legitimacy of a just war, such was his abhorrence of violence, his deep sense of the inherent sanctity of all human life, that he sometimes flung himself with reckless courage into the way of militant mobs intent on wreaking terrible revenge on individuals they regarded as police informers, sell-outs or simply those termed \"system blacks\", performing jobs within the apartheid bureaucracy. The ranks of the broad liberation movement were riddled at the time with informers, often young activists who had been captured and \"turned\" by the security forces - either through torture, the threat of execution or just plain bribery - into spies for the apartheid state and informers on their erstwhile comrades. The security forces called them askaris, to the comrades they were impimpis. This fabricated word has no known linguistic derivation, but seemed to resonate with the special odium of a pimp, with a prefix and suffix added. As far as the comrades were concerned, impimpis had to be killed, and the chosen method of execution in the adrenalised fury of those days was by a cruel method known as necklacing, which involved putting a car tyre around the victim\\'s neck, filling it with petrol and setting it ablaze. On at least two occasions, Tutu, a small and quite frail man, then in his fifties, stopped the executions by plunging into the frenzied crowd and rescuing the intended victim. The first occasion was when Tutu and a colleague, Bishop Simeon Nkoane, came upon a mob attacking a man some accused of being an informer as mourners were leaving the funeral of four comrades who had been killed the previous week in what looked like security force assassinations. Yelling, \"Impimpi! Impimpi!\" the mob beat the man to the ground, doused him with petrol and were about to set him ablaze when Tutu reached the victim and, with Nkoane\\'s help, pulled him away and put him in Nkoane\\'s nearby car. When Tutu admonished the crowd, telling them theirs should be a noble and righteous struggle, they shouted back at him, \"Why don\\'t you let us deal with these dogs the way they treat us?\" The second rescue was at the funeral of a prominent civil rights lawyer, Griffiths Mxenge, who had been butchered by state assassins who hacked him to death with pangas, knives and daggers late at night on a football field in Durban. Mxenge\\'s terrible death aroused intense anger throughout the liberation movement and, again, as mourners left the makeshift platform where Tutu had delivered the funeral oration outside a tiny Eastern Cape hamlet, the cry of \"Impimpi\" went up from the crowd, and a group of youths pounced on a man among them. As they pummelled him to the ground, a tyre appeared seemingly from nowhere. But before it could be slipped around his neck, Tutu burst through the group and flung himself across the bleeding man\\'s prostrate body, calling to the crowd to back off. They withdrew reluctantly and, as Tutu stood up, his cassock stained with the man\\'s blood, he called to aides to carry the man to a car and drive him away. They did so but, later that night, to Tutu\\'s dismay, the avengers tracked the man down and completed their execution. Tutu, appalled by the continuation of necklace killings and frustrated by his inability to stop them, threatened at one point to leave the country if the incendiary comrades did not heed him. The young radicals were unimpressed. \"Let him go,\" a group of them declared after meeting in Soweto to discuss his threat, \"then we can get on with the revolution without him restraining us.\" Tutu again felt the hostility of the youths to his pleas for moderation when he addressed a huge funeral rally of some 45 000 in the Johannesburg township of Alexandra at the height of the violence in February 1986. He had tried to intercede by conveying the community\\'s grievances to the government, and had to report back that the authorities had done no more than undertake to look into their objections. The anger of the crowd was directed at him. For once his sparkling rhetoric failed to stir them. Sullen faces stared at him as he delivered his address and there were even some shouted interruptions. Afterwards a smaller group surrounded him and tried to prevent him from leaving as they bombarded him with questions about how he expected them to redress their injustices. Eventually an aide muscled his way through the crowd and pushed Tutu into a car. The government, meanwhile, continued to accuse him of condoning violence. Yet it was Tutu\\'s advocacy of the seemingly milder issue of economic sanctions and disinvestment that made life even more difficult for him, prompting a furious reaction in the white community and, most painfully for him, disapproval within the body of his own Anglican Church and among his white liberal supporters as well. Such eminent figures as Alan Paton, the celebrated author and leader of South Africa\\'s Liberal Party, and Helen Suzman, who for 13 tough years was the sole human-rights voice speaking out forcefully in the all-white and overwhelmingly male Parliament in Cape Town, opposed him vigorously. \"I do not understand how your Christian conscience allows you to advocate disinvestmentâ€¦\" Paton wrote angrily to Tutu. \"It would go against my deepest principles to advocate anything that could put a man, and especially a black man, out of a job.\" But Tutu was steadfast, insisting that the vast majority of black people would willingly endure such hardships if it would bring an end to the system of apartheid under which they all lived. Tutu triggered this surge of condemnation during a visit to Denmark when he chastised the Danes in a television interview for buying South African coal. When the interviewer asked whether a boycott would not cause black workers to lose their jobs, Tutu replied that such suffering would be temporary, while the suffering caused by apartheid looked as though it was \"going to go on and on and on\". The government went ballistic. Interior minister Alwyn Schlebusch, who was responsible for issuing passports, expressed his \"disgust\" and summoned Tutu to Pretoria to tell him he was guilty of economic sabotage and should retract or apologise. Police minister Louis le Grange delivered a furious speech in Parliament, accusing Tutu of promoting disinvestment, the evasion of military service, labour unrest and furthering the aims and objects of the ANC - all crimes under South Africa\\'s security legislation. President Botha denounced him as \"public enemy number one\" and called on church members to repudiate him. But Tutu remained unrepentant, arguing that economic pressure was necessary to bring about change in the country. When a group of business leaders who were members of the Anglican Church met with Tutu to remonstrate with him, he listened carefully and then - according to the Reverend Njongonkulu Ndungane, who was the church\\'s public relations officer at the time and later Tutu\\'s successor as Archbishop of Cape Town - responded with a challenge of his own: \"If you can tell me of an alternative non-violent strategy that will bring an end to apartheid,\" he said, \"then I will abandon my commitment to sanctions and go round the world pursuing your approach until we reach our goal. But if you cannot, then I will stick with sanctions.\" According to Ndungane, the businessmen had nothing to suggest. For several years, egged on by sustained vilification from the right-wing press and the pro- government national broadcasting service, Tutu was the subject of blind hatred in the mainstream white population. He received abusive phone calls and death threats. Crude graffiti appeared on walls. One day a group of right-wing extremists wearing crash helmets burst into his office, yelled abuse at him and flung 30 silver coins at his desk. A special dirty tricks unit of the state security service, called the Strategic Communications (Stratcom), started a smear campaign through pamphlets and planting of whispered slanders to members of the pro-government media - culminating in a bizarre operation when Stratcom agents hung the foetus of a monkey outside Tutu\\'s home in an apparent attempt to make supposed superstitious township folk think he was under some kind of witchcraft spell. In fact, all it did was bemuse them. The hate campaign reached a climax on 31 August 1988 when President Botha ordered his most ruthless special operations unit to bomb the building housing the South African Council of Churches (SACC) headquarters, called Khotso house (House of Peace), in downtown Johannesburg. The bombing, carried out at night, destroyed the multi-storeyed building but fortunately injured no one. Moreover, Tutu had left the SACC by that time and was serving as Archbishop of Cape Town, but the fact that the head of state had gone to such lengths as to personally order so dramatic an attack reflected the visceral hatred he and his government felt for Tutu and the organisation he had mobilised to arouse the conscience of the world against what they bluntly called the \"evil\" of apartheid. n From \\'Tutu: The Authorised Portrait\\' by Allister Sparks and Mpho A Tutu, published by Pan Macmillan South Africa in association with PQ Blackwell.

Greenpeace, an environmental organisation has made this possible with the first solar powered tent which will change the way we view movies during Cop17. This is part of an energy evolution drive that the environmentalist\\'s will be involved in during the conference. The white solar powered tent which arrives in Durban this week, will be situated at North Beach near the Amphitheatre and will screen environmental documentaries focusing on climate change and renewable energy solution exhibitions. Shoana Hutton, the solar cinema co-ordinator told the Tribune more about what the public can expect. \"Inspiring documentaries on climate change and its impacts on African countries will be screened. A look at the world\\'s second largest forest through pictures and documentaries and poems from the DRC will also be showcased,\" said Hutton. The tent premiÃ¨res on November 28, and screening begins at 10am everyday during COP17 and will be open to the public at no charge. \"We are hoping to inform the public to use solar and wind powered energy and encourage them to change from using dirty coal and dangerous nuclear energy,\" said Andrew Orpen, the renewable solution co-ordinator. According to Orpen, the venue will be powered by 12 solar panels and four wind turbines charging a battery bank which will power all the appliances in the tent. \"The 4.5 by 3.5 screen projecting images and four large television LED screens will be powered by renewable energy,\" said Orpen. Greenpeace will have an online petition in which they will encourage the public to sign to persuade government to use more renewable energy.

      "ONE of the world\\'s most extreme cases of climate injustice happens to be the site for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties 17 (COP17) climate summit. According to our government\\'s National Climate Change Response White Paper: \"potential impacts on South Africa in the medium- to long-term are significant and potentially catastrophic\" for, under conservative assumptions, \"after 2050, warming is projected to reach around 3 to 4Â°C along the coast, and 6 to 7Â°C in the interior\". Still, put aside banal \"Working together, saving tomorrow today\" spin-doctoring. Instead, ask whether the COP17\\'s certain failure to cut greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent by 2020 and 90 percent by 2050 - as scientists tell us is required and as was shunned in 16 prior meetings largely thanks to big-power sabotage - will also be catastrophic for South Africa\\'s ruling party and ruling class. Superficially, an easy gut response is no - for otherwise, why give the COP17 presidency to Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, who less than four months ago revealed her commitment to the planet by hiring a R240 000 executive jet to take her from Norway to Bulgaria when she refused to board a commercial flight which required that her handbag go through the Oslo airport metal-detector, as for all such dignitaries? Such frivolity appeared again when Nkoana-Mashabane ignored applications for the Dalai Lama\\'s visa, as far back as June, so he could attend last month\\'s celebration of Archbishop Desmond Tutu\\'s 80th birthday party - reminding us of the same situation 30 months earlier when Beijing proudly announced Pretoria was under its thumb. Accusing Nkoana-Mashabane of being \"very economical with the truth\", Tutu announced: \"Our government is worse than the apartheid government, because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government. \"Hey Mr Zuma, you and your government don\\'t represent me. You represent your own interests.\" The COP17 host\\'s \"own interests\" appear to be grounded in the crony-capitalist \"minerals-energy complex\", in which Zuma\\'s family has been dabbling, in the process exhibiting extreme environmental irresponsibility as witnessed by a nephew\\'s and legal adviser\\'s destruction of the Aurora mines and surrounding environs. Although Pretoria claims a desire for the Kyoto Protocol\\'s extension after 2012, this appears a rhetorical gambit to bait-and-switch on the other African delegates, now holed up at the Hilton, because satisfying both Washington and Beijing also ensures our own elites\\' prosperity. If PresidentJacob Zuma\\'sgovernment really cared about his closest historical constituencies in rural KwaZulu-Natal villages, who are among those most adversely affected by worsening droughts and floods, then it would halt the |R250-plus-billion-worth of coal-fired electricity generators being built by Eskom at Medupi and Kusile. The state would also shut the world\\'s single largest CO2 emissions source, Sasol\\'s Secunda plant, which makes oil from coal, and also reverse the R80 billion heavy oil refinery authorised for construction at Coega, north of Port Elizabeth. It would reverse its trillion-rand nuclear energy fantasy and deny approval to 40 proposed new coal mines in Mpumalanga, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal allegedly needed |to supply the plants and export markets in coming years, on the grounds that these will cause permanent contamination of rivers and water tables, increased mercury residues and global warming. Pretoria would offer a Just Transition package to all affected workers, transforming their thousands of lost jobs in fossil fuel industries into employment in renewables, public transport, building refurbishment, appropriate production and disposal, reformed agriculture, healthcare and education, as demanded by labour, environmentalists and communities in the Million Climate Jobs campaign. No, aside from minor PR embarrassment when Greenpeace nails Kusile or Earthlife points out Eskom and Sasol reps on its COP17 delegation, Zuma\\'s government doesn\\'t care, as witnessed in the blatantly corrupt ANC deal with Hitachi to supply boilers to Medupi and Kusile, a multimillion-rand bonsela approved by former environment minister, Eskom chair and ANC finance committee member, Valli Moosa. As both victim and villain, SA is a poster-child for elite mismanagement of the climate threat. A good measure of our economic elites\\' addiction to fossil fuels is carbon intensity per capita unit of output, and we have among the world\\'s highest, far worse than even that great climate Satan, the US. An insignificant contribution to the energy grid - less than 4 percent in 2010 - comes from SA\\'s incredible renewable potential in solar, tidal and wind sources. Instead, electricity produced by burning filthy coal is cross-subsidised so it is the cheapest available anywhere in the world for the world\\'s largest mining and metals corporations, BHP Billiton and Anglo American Corporation. Their smelters were revealed in 2010 to be paying less than R0.15/kilowatt-hour thanks to \"special pricing agreements\". The NGO Earthlife squeezed that data from Eskom via the Access to Information Act, now surely impossible thanks to Parliament\\'s Secrecy Bill passage last week. Other large corporations received electricity in 2009 at R0.40/kWh, still the world\\'s lowest price - and although rates have soared dramatically, to more than R1/kWh for many small pre-paid meter household consumers, the lowest increases were imposed on the biggest firms, locked in ultra-cheap for BHP Billiton and Anglo by 40-year apartheid-era deals cut just before 1994. Worse, these are not SA companies reinvesting in our economy, for the main metals/mining firms export their profits both through illegal transfer pricing - a general practice costing us a fifth of GDP in 2007, according to a recent Wits study - and through straight repatriation of dividends to shareholders in London (Anglo) and Melbourne (BHP Billiton). And SA internal consumption of their metals is constrained due to notorious local over-pricing. Meanwhile, millions of poor people are regularly disconnected or denied access to the grid due to extreme poverty, affecting nearly half the country\\'s families. Warfare is under way against municipalities and Eskom in the form of ubiquitous \"service delivery protests\" whose recent root causes in high-priced electricity can be traced to climate change via the bill for Medupi/|Kusile construction, controversially financed by the World Bank\\'s largest-ever loan. The bank claims Medupi will help the poor, once again standing reality on its head. Moreover, because of backsliding from clean electricity to dirty household energy like coal, wood or paraffin, the passage from HIV-positive to full-blown Aids status is rapid via respiratory-related opportunistic infections, including the raging TB epidemic, especially affecting women exposed to particulates when cooking over biomass. In addition to these factors, the ANC government contributes to climate injustice via convoluted global geopolitics. Tellingly, Zuma joined the US, Brazil, India and China as co-sponsors of the Copenhagen Accord in December 2009. The Copenhagen gambit meant that the World Trade Organisation\\'s notorious divide-and-rule politics - endorsed to Africa\\'s dismay by SA trade minister Alec Erwin at the 1999 Seattle, 2001 Doha and 2003 CancÃºn summits but vetoed by the African delegation at the first and third - would become the norm for UN climate negotiations. Another UN process, the High-Level Advisory Group on Finance, included SA Planning Minister Trevor Manuel. Last November, Manuel suggested making up to half the anticipated North-South climate financing - supposedly, $100 billion a year by 2020 - available via the stuttering carbon markets. Manuel was named co-chair of the transitional committee to design the Green Climate Fund in March, and against other countries\\' wishes he ruled the World Bank could continue as fund trustee even though that violates UN conflict-of-interest rules. Meantime, the price of pollution in the European carbon markets favoured by Manuel fell from a high of more than e30 a ton in 2006 to less than eight this week, with Zurich\\'s UBS bank last week predicting a coming low of e3 a ton. Not only do carbon markets avoid the North\\'s needed emissions cuts and energy transformation, they are subject to the kind of fraud, gaming and extreme volatility we have come to expect from financiers. Would you want control of the world economy by the likes of Goldman Sachs - repeated violator of even deregulated financial laws in the wild-west US - to extend, now, to our planet\\'s survival? If so, you will more honestly change the COP acronym to \"Conference of Polluters\", and revise your slogan to clearly reflect Pretoria\\'s interests: \"Warming together, stealing tomorrow today\". n This is an excerpt from Patrick Bond\\'s new book, \\'The Politics of Climate Justice\\', published last week by the University of KwaZulu-Natal Press\n",

      "That was why a legally binding agreement setting targets for the immediate reduction of carbon emissions, as well as the finalisation of a Green Climate Fund agreement were essential at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\'s 17th Conference of Parties. Creating a Green Climate Fund and ensuring long-term funding for mitigation and adaptation in the developing world has been vital not only to ensure communities did not suffer food and water shortages or have their lives claimed by climatic changes in future, but also for the development of technology and skills to come up with alternate ways of providing the services and development needed without increasing carbon emissions. Despite South Africa being the 13th highest carbon emitter in the world, particularly because of its reliance on coal-based power supply, Africa is the lowest contributor to climate change. But, it is to be the hardest hit. It was for this reason that hosting COP17 on African soil was important, said Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa. \"We are highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as rain-fed agriculture. Combined with the severe development challenges the continent already faces, this makes Africans particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,\" she said. The World Bank\\'s Andrew Steer emphasised that climate change was about poverty reduction. \"Developing countries will bear three-quarters of the negative impact of changing weather patterns, water shortages, and rising sea levels, and they are the least equipped to deal with them. \"Hard won gains in poverty reduction are at serious risk. This is no longer just tomorrow\\'s problem. Impacts are being felt today,\" he said. In a recent World Bank blog, Steer said four out of five countries that the Bank worked with listed climate change among the top priorities for their anti-poverty plans. In the past 12 months, nearly 90 percent of country assistance strategies requested by developing countries, and approved by the World Bank\\'s Board, listed climate change as one of the major pillars for World Bank support. Figures showed that the average African generated about 13 times less greenhouse gases than his counterpart in North America. Molewa said without an overriding mitigation and adaptation agenda, the continent may see these figures rise in years to come, as development and population rates grow. \"Africa needs to embark on a path of sustainable development with new, clean, appropriate technologies and to build climate resilient communities, so as to avoid the environmental mistakes of the developed world,\" she said. Part of South Africa\\'s contribution to a cleaner development agenda has been the publication of the Climate Change Response White Paper which targets sectors such as health and agriculture for green development, the signing of an agreement with European governments and the European Investment Bank through which the South African Renewables Initiative (SARi) aimed to \"scale-up and secure long-term funding to enable the growth of the renewable energy industry in South Africa\". Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies also announced South Africa would source more goods locally. The UN report - \"A Brief for Policymakers on the Green Economy and the Millennium Development Goals\" (MDGs) - stated that investing in clean energy, sustainable transport, forests and environmentally-friendly agriculture were essential, if internationally-agreed goals to reduce poverty were to be achieved. The report, reviewing the implementation progress five years before the MDG deadline of 2015, made it clear that environmental degradation was making it more difficult for governments to achieve MDGs. This included improving maternal health, providing safe drinking water and combating hunger and disease. Conversely some countries and communities were finding that environmental improvements, catalysed by deliberate policy choices; smart investments and often private sector partnerships can be a big part of the solution, the study found. Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), said there was rapidly growing evidence that accelerating a transition to a low carbon, resource efficient, employment-generating Green Economy may not only be the key to meeting sustainability challenges of the 21st century, but also provide a considerable contribution to meeting other MDGs. \"On current trends it is likely that achieving all the MDGs by 2015 will be missed. In part because the responses so far have been embedded in a 20th century approach to a new century\\'s challenges,\" he said. The Green Economy, he added, put a fresh lens on the challenges and a spotlight on the multiple cost-effective economic and social opportunities from investing and re-investing in modern clean-tech energy systems up to natural resource management of the planet\\'s ecological infrastructure. \"In doing so, it addresses the economic, social and environmental objective of sustainable development and underscores the wealth of choices and options for sustained progress that meets the realities of our time,\" he said. The report underlined that the environmental goods and services that underpinned the global economy - and, in particular, the GDP of the poor - were shrinking at a rapid rate. The loss of ecological infrastructure, it said, was not only undermining the MDG on environmental sustainability, but also all of the other MDGs and their associated targets. The loss of forests, which were key sources of drinking water and nutrients for agriculture while providing essential goods such as wild foods and medicines, affected the MDGs on hunger and health, and the target of halving the number of people without access to drinking water. While there was no specific MDG for energy, the report stated that providing clean energy underpinned the success of many of the goals, both directly in terms of sustainable development and indirectly if climate change, linked to the burning of fossil fuels, was left unaddressed. One way of financing the achievement of the MDGs was through re-directing subsidies.\n",

      "South Africa should be looking at spreading its sources of energy, including wind, solar and shale gas, as its energy needs were likely to double in the next 20 years, according to Tulsi Tanti, whose India-based wind turbine supplier Suzlon is investing heavily in a wind-energy plant outside Cookhouse in the Eastern Cape. The R2.5 billion project has been announced by Suzlon in partnership with developer African Clean Energy Developments (ACED) and the African Infrastructure Managers - a company held by Old Mutual Investment Group South Africa and Macquarie Capital and AFPOC. Working closely with its partner, the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa and with its appointed mandated lead arrangers - Standard Bank and Nedbank - the ACED finalised a financing package, which Suzlon says \"notably includes a significant portion of broad-based black economic empowerment (BEE) ownership\". The Cookhouse Wind Farm Community Trust - representing communities from the Cookhouse, Somerset East and Bedford areas - will own 15 percent of the plant. Tanti, the chairman of Suzlon, who was visiting Cape Town last week after meeting South Africa\\'s Energy Minister Dipuo Peters at the World Economic Forum at Davos last month, said for each 100 megawatts of electricity it was believed that at least 20 jobs were created, including two permanent jobs and about 18 indirect jobs. During the construction of each wind turbine - of which there will be 200 built - one or two jobs would be created and up to 18 for every 100MW of installed generating capacity. Suzlon - the world\\'s fifth largest wind turbine manufacturer- has been awarded a contract to supply 2.1MW turbines. Up to 200 wind turbines will be erected on an incremental basis over the next two years with the first sods been turned in April. Initially the turbines will be imported from Suzlon\\'s plant in Pune - near Mumbai - in India, while the blades will be imported from the US and the towers from Europe. Tanti said it was envisaged that the construction of the towers and blades would take place in SA. He said this project had the potential to employ 1 000 engineers. \"We intend to source our engineers locally,\" he said, noting that the training would be done at appropriate local training institutions. Tanti said South Africa needed more energy and thousands of decent and sustainable \"green\" jobs. The wind energy sector was well positioned to deliver both of these requirements, he believed. \"We bring to the table our reliable technology and operating experience from 32 countries and are confident that South Africa will see significant growth in this space in the decades to come.\" It was envisaged that the electricity produced at the wind plant at Cookhouse would feed into the national electricity grid administered by Eskom, he added. Tanti said that, at present, wind energy was more expensive to produce than coal-fuelled electricity in SA, although cheaper than gas fuelled electricity. However, as the wind plants expanded economies of scale would bring down the cost of wind energy. Former City Power managing director Silas Zimu will head the Suzlon office in Johannesburg, but the company would also have a sales presence in Cape Town. \"As a group we are committed to local empowerment and to enable environmental, ecological and sustainable growth. Cookhouse is a fantastic first project to turn that vision into a welcome realit,\" he said.\n",

      "THE North West Health Department has launched an investigation into the supply of coal to its hospitals after complaints that it is substandard, overpriced and being ordered incorrectly. If the allegations prove true, then the department is spending millions extra on coal - paying premium prices for poor-quality coal which sources say is damaging hospital boilers. An internal audit unit has been appointed to head the probe. Aside from paying premium prices for substandard coal, the audit unit will also probe allegations that hospitals are not following the correct supply chain management procedures to order, deliver and pay for coal supplied. There are also allegations of|collusion between suppliers and hospital staff, as some companies were hired by the hospitals despite not having the correct tax clearance certificates. They are also looking into allegations that hospitals are receiving less coal than what they have ordered. Provincial health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane admitted there had been several complaints in recent years about the quality and quantity of coal which was being delivered to hospitals. \"The department has asked the provincial internal audit to look into these complaints and action will be taken as appropriate,\" Lekgethwane said. As a result of a complaint by a \"rival supplier\", a sample of coal delivered to one of the hospitals had been taken for testing, he added. The Sunday Independent understands that the department last year spent more than R4 million in just six months ordering coal for three of the five hospitals in one of its four districts. Twelve North West hospitals have boilers which use coal for energy generation, heating and laundry. Hospitals order between 100 and 400 tons a month. The Sunday Independent has seen quotations from March 2012, showing that hospitals were offered coal at R1 300 a ton. If a hospital only orders 100 tons at that price monthly, they would spend about R1.5m on coal a year. If all 12 ordered the minimum of 100 tons, it would cost the province R18.7m. But a source in the coal industry, who asked not to be named, because he does work for the government, said the coal price would fluctuate depending on prices from the mines. Also, hospitals are likely to order more coal during winter. Another source in the hospital\\'s workshops, who spoke to The Sunday Independent on condition of anonymity, says suppliers are overcharging the hospitals by delivering B or C-grade coal, instead of the pricier A-grade product hospitals are paying for. The coal industry source held the same view, saying the government was being cheated out of millions. And they say the lower-grade coal has damaged hospital boilers, resulting in the department paying out several million rand for repairs. The department\\'s budget estimates from last year show it spent more than R8.5m on the repair and maintenance of its boilers across the province. The department\\'s probe comes as it deliberates over a tender to supply coal to the four regions. It is the first time in five years that a tender has been advertised. Senior officials in the department have allegedly been flouting the Public Finance Management Act and Treasury regulations, which call for procurement worth more than R500 000 to be put out to tender. Instead, suppliers have been appointed on a monthly quotation system which is rotated. The tender, which was due to close on August 17, has, however, been extended until October 22. But the department is adamant the quotation system is in line with all prescripts. Lekgethwane said there was nothing untoward with the extension of the tender. The department had cancelled a 2007 tender because the supplier was unable to deliver. Lekgethwane said the department had taken over the managing of the contract from the Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport, previously responsible for boiler maintenance. \"It took a while before the department could get appropriate specifications for the tender to be advertised,\" he said. \"There is not a rotation system in the department. At any time that there is the need for coal supply, quotations are asked from suppliers and appropriately adjudicated. What the hospitals have been guarding against is giving the work to only one supplier to the exclusion of all others,\" he said. Lekgethwane denied that sub-standard coal was destroying hospital boilers. \"Maintenance of boilers is an on-going exercise especiallyâ€¦ [in] old hospital establishments like ours. It cannot be definitively said that the maintenance is due to the poor quality,\" he said. But a source, who works in the workshop at one of the hospitals and could not be named, as he is not allowed to speak to the media, confirmed that part of the boilers\\' problems was caused by the quality of the coal. \"The type of coal is not good. Sometimes the suppliers send us [coal] peas that are too big. Those do not burn properly inside the boilers, which then doesn\\'t reach the proper temperatures.\" He said management knew about the problem, but nothing was being done.\n",

      "Business has had mixed reactions to PresidentJacob Zuma\\'sState of the Nation address saying that while it welcomed the continued focus on infrastructure development, there were areas of concern. The SA Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sacci) said they would have liked to have seen more focus on small and medium enterprises in the State of the Nation speech. Sacci\\'s chief operating officer Peggy Drodskie said the organisation applauded Zuma\\'s tackling of the health, education and skills development issues. But she said, it would have liked more detail on small and medium enterprises. \"We would have liked to have seen some statement on how the environment in which they work would be improved.\" One of the areas the organisation had hoped Zuma would focus on was the issue of violent strikes that have dealt a heavy blow to business confidence over the past year. Drodskie said they welcomed Zuma\\'s focus on violent strikers. In his speech, Zuma said he had \"instructed the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster to put measures in place, with immediate effect, to ensure that any incidents of violent protest are acted upon, investigated and prosecuted. Courts will be allocated to deal with such cases on a prioritised roll. The law must be enforced and it must be seen to be enforced - fairly, effectively and expeditiously. \"We fully stand behind the rights of labour to protest but some of the protests over the last year, particularly since Marikana have been very damaging to South Africa\\'s reputation, particularly for foreign investment.\" In response to Zuma\\'s confirmation that mines would not be nationalised but that the government was investigating royalty agreements, the SA Chamber of Mines\\' chief executive Bheki Sibiya carefully noted: \"In the spirit of stakeholder partnership we look forward to being invited to contribute towards this research to ensure that its outcomes are fully informed to improve the tax regime. \"The mining industry is already making significant contributions in taxes and makes further contributions through royalties on super profits. We are hopeful that the research will make recommendations that will ensure an equitable tax system for all sectors of the economy.\" Sibaya also praised the government for the R860 billion committed to infrastructure projects, saying they were particularly positive about the move from road to rail transportation for coal. \"We are pleased that the Majuba rail coal line will begin soon and hope that its construction will be completed within targeted time frames.\" Adcorp labour economist Loane Sharp said the threat of rising taxes and the possible impact on small businesses were his greatest concerns stemming from the speech. \"My first reaction is to the threat of rising taxes. The president indicated that expenditures and taxation would be looked at and, if necessary, taxes would need to rise. That is very concerning because 1 percent of taxpayers shoulder 25 percent of income taxes at present and any further increases in taxes for this group would lead to widespread tax evasion,\" he said. \"Already small businesses are disappearing into the informal sector at an alarming rate - 440 000 of them stopped reporting their incomes to the authorities after 2006, so that is a very concerning development.\" He also questioned the ANC\\'s continued political alliance with trade union Cosatu. \"That alliance is the biggest single obstacle to job creation in the country. Cosatu-aligned trade unions have usurped authority in the health, education, policing and municipal sectors with disastrous results,\" he said. \"The public sector unions represent a grave risk to South Africa\\'s long-term employment prospects.\" Founder and chairman of the Sekunjalo Group Iqbal SurvÃ© described Zuma\\'s State of the Nation address on Thursday as a nuts and bolts approach that would take the country \"back to basics\". Detailing the positive aspects of the speech, SurvÃ© said it was clear that infrastructure development would continue, \"which is good for business\", and that it had been clearly established that mining would not be nationalised. He said the speech acknowledged the difficulties of the past few months, such as Marikana and the farmworkers\\' strike, and was a \"good way of tackling the root causes of these problems\". However, he said he would have liked to have seen more support for entrepreneurs, and how the jobs fund would be used to ensure growth in entrepreneurship. Recently appointed on to the government\\'s Jobs Fund Committee, SurvÃ© said this was an area he would be focusing on. He would also liked to have seen more on growing the green economy and sustainability, he said. \"In business we tend to see the government as solving problems but we as business also need to come to the party.\" SurvÃ© said on his visit to Davos for the World Economic Forum he had come across many South Africans from the business and government sphere who were saying the same thing. \"What we\\'re saying to people is that South Africa is good. We\\'re not as bad as it looks on TV; we\\'re not a basket case. We\\'re saying don\\'t just come to South Africa as a tourist, rather partner with us.\"\n",

      "Mozambican army clashes with former rebels may disrupt coal shipments and public transportation without heralding a return to civil war, said analysts such as Alex Vine, head of the African program at Chatham House. The Mozambique National Resistance, known as Renamo, said it was ending the 21-year-old peace agreement with the southern African nation\\'s ruling party after army troops captured its headquarters in the Gorongosa mountains on Oct. 21. The action followed Renamo attacks on arms depots and buses this year that killed several people and forced the closing of rail lines used by coal mines owned by Rio Tinto. \"The markets are concerned â€” adds additional risk for lenders and could make it more difficult for Mozambique to raise funds for infrastructure if this drags on,\" London-based Vines said yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions. \"The coal mining companies have also seen their costs rise.\" Renamo fought a 17-year civil war against the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, until signing a peace agreement in Rome in 1992. It has served as the main opposition party for two decades without threatening Frelimo\\'s hold on the presidency and parliament. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama\\'s electoral support dropped to 16.4 percent in 2009 from 47.7 percent a decade before. \"The leadership of Renamo is making a last-minute desperate attempt to get concessions from the Frelimo government,\" Robert Besseling, senior Africa Analyst at IHS Country Risk, said in phone interview from Johannesburg. \"They know that this is the end for them.\" Fueled by transportation, communications, the world\\'s largest discovery of natural gas in the past decade and coal mining operations run by Rio Tinto and Vale, Mozambique\\'s $15 billion economy is expected to expand 7.4 percent this year, according to government forecasts. The former Portuguese colony plans to open a liquefied natural gas terminal in 2018 that will be the second-largest export site in the world after Ras Laffan in Qatar. Anadarko Petroleum and Eni are among companies investing in gas production in the country. \"The primary risk to gas development will be elevated risk perceptions,\" Mark Rosenberg, an Africa analyst for New York- based Eurasia Group, said in an emailed response to questions. \"Given the geography of the nascent gas infrastructure and that Renamo cannot sustain a wide-ranging or prolonged insurgency, physical risks from recent events are quite low.\" State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf Wednesday urged both sides to \"take steps to move back from the brink.\" Pursued by the army, Dhlakama is now holed up in the central province of Sofala, close to his bush strongholds during the civil war. Support from the former white-minority governments in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and South Africa that backed Renamo during the conflict has ended. \"It\\'s only in a very small area of Mozambique where Renamo still has a presence and a fighting capability,\" Besseling said. \"It does not have the capability to stage large-scale attacks on the military.\" Dhlakama is ready for talks with Frelimo and believes the government must \"show signs of detente\" so that he can appear in public, Lourenco do Rosario, rector of the Politechnic University of Mozambique, said yesterday in an interview after meeting with a Renamo delegation in the capital, Maputo. He\\'s criticized President Armando Guebuza\\'s government for allegedly politicizing state offices and for setting up an electoral system that favors Frelimo. With general elections set for October next year, there\\'s no indication that Frelimo is prepared to make concessions. \"Serious gas players will expect a certain amount of political jockeying around resources in the run-up to local and then national elections,\" John Smelcer, director of Africa Mining & Energy Projects at the Johannesburg-based law firm, Webber Wentzel, said yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions from Maputo. \"They also likely understand that Renamo is no longer capable of projecting a serious threat across the country.\" - Washington Post and Bloomberg\n",

      "Article 116:\n",
      "Forget the State of the Nation address, worry about how to address the problem of a nation in a state over red overalls, jammed signals and riot police in the National Assembly. The EFF, led by Julius Malema, former leader of the ANC Youth League, did not care that this address marked the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Freedom Charter. That nonchalance is curious, considering that the expulsion of Malema from the ANC can be traced, among other things, to his persistent calls for the nationalisation of mines, in line with the provisions of the Freedom Charter. The red berets were not interested in President Jacob Zuma\\'s quoting recent StatsSA figures that 15.3 million people were in employment. They were not there to listen to him share his administration\\'s nine-point plan to create jobs, including: the beneficiation of mineral wealth and the dedication of 30 percent of the public procurement budget to supplies by SMMEs, co-operatives and township enterprises. His commitment to giving Eskom R23bn in the next fiscal|year, and the expected long-term 15 000 megawatts that could come from the Grand Inga hydropower project, did not strike a chord with the party that has brought more action to Parliament than any other in the history of South Africa. He could have promised them the world. They would not have believed a word. To them, the president is not \"going to come back... but disappear after the State of the Nation address\". In Malema\\'s words, the \"man cannot be trusted... he must resign\". Lesson? People in power, be careful what sort of youth you raise in your ranks. Condemn their actions when they insult others to make a point while they are among your ranks. If you do not, they will turn on you when they run out of people to affront and, while they are at it, reduce the State of the Nation address to a freak show of water cannon and scuffles. After all, how long before mining is truly transformed? The fracas that preceded the address obliterated from memory the biggest mining show to come to town, a few blocks from Parliament. Thousands of delegates spent three days networking, discussing and making deals in mining. Minister of Mineral Resources Ngoako Ramatlhodi did his best to reassure investors that the mining sector was becoming more attractive. In his address, Zuma reiterated that the monitoring of compliance by mining companies with the Mining Charter was continuing. Of more interest was his decision to refer the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act back to Parliament because of its perceived constitutional shortcomings. Among the key criticisms of the act was the concern that its proposed designation of certain minerals as strategic resources might be in violation of South Africa\\'s obligations to the World Trade Organisation\\'s stipulations. A week ago in Addis Ababa, the AU recommended that Africans find sustainable ways to manage the continent\\'s resources, including beneficiation and adding of value to minerals. Backtracking on the declaration of certain minerals as strategic reflects a lack of the resolve in dealing with an issue that is holding Africa back. We export raw minerals cheaply and import the same minerals in a processed form. Investors prefer certainty. They would rather receive the bad news, deal with it and move on, than legislative and policy processes that in the end skirt the issues. The slump in commodity prices can only mean a rise in private equity deals in mining this year. While those looking for mining assets to buy are excited by their prospective finds, the interests of the communities affected by African\\'s mining activities remain pegged to the vagaries of the international prices of resources over which they have no control. It is time South Africa took a stand on this matter once and for all. Gold in Namibia, graphite in Mozambique, and what with the South Sudanese prospects? Events such as the mining indaba this week tend to raise all sorts of unlikely headlines about the industry. Even as South Sudan is making headlines for its attempts to make something out of the power-sharing deal, I read reports that its Minister of Foreign Affairs, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, was at the Cape Town International Convention Centre talking about mining in his country. A country that is 98 percent dependent on oil has to find alternative sources of revenue, more so when its leadership crisis and squabbles with its northern neighbour make it hard to generate oil revenues. Apparently, before his fallout with his deputy, President Salva Kiir had been visiting Arab countries to raise investments for the sector. In his position, I would first rush to restore leadership and parliamentary order to Juba before talking about mining in Cape Town, but then maybe that is why Kiir is running South Sudan, and not me. Two countries that had every reason to be at the indaba to talk about mining were Namibia and Mozambique. Both have held fairly peaceful elections, their economies are growing at a reasonable pace and they have an impressive record of attracting mining investments. I had mistakenly associated Namibia with only uranium and diamond mining. The headline that impressed me was about an investment by a Swedish jeweller, Kristallen, in a gold refinery in the country. This pleased me, but mostly Namibia\\'s Minister of Trade and Industry, Calle Schlettwein, who expressed a need for his country to have its own gold refinery, although it might not have enough gold to refine. There are only two gold mines in Namibia, the Navachab Gold Mine in the Erongo region and the Otjikoto B2Gold Mine in Otjozondupa. No wonder the Namibian property market has been in non-stop growth mode for five years. Tanzania is expecting a slowdown in production and Zimbabwe is continuing to punch below its weight on the mining front, but Mozambique is making new finds in its north. An Australian company, Mozambi Resources, announced last week the signing of its option to acquire two graphite licences in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. One of these areas is reportedly near Triton Minerals\\' Nicanda Hill - considered the world\\'s largest-known deposit of graphite and vanadium. As if the coal and gas were not enough for the land of Eduardo Mondlane and Samora Machel, investors keep on streaming in. Watch out for this future hub of southern Africa! IMF on Ecobank: are we cool? South Africa has two main investors in the pan-African bank, Africa\\'s largest by footprint, the Ecobank Transnational Incorporated or simply Ecobank. These are the 20 percent shareholder, Nedbank, which paid R5bn for its stake in the Togolese-registered bank in October. The other is the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), with an 18 percent stake. A week or so ago, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised the concern that the aggressive growth by the bank posed governance risks. Subsequent reports even extended the story of the risk to the entire continent. I found that rather alarmist. Ecobank had tackled the corporate governance issue, including the dismissal of its then-group chief executive officer, Thierry Tanoh, who sued for defamation and unfair dismissal. To equate whatever governance issues there have been at Ecobank to a continent-wide crisis is a tad dramatic. The problem is that institutions like the IMF have a huge following and influence. A lot can go wrong before appropriate public relations\\' interventions can restore the confidence of the investing public in the company or country concerned. Since the publishing of the report \"Pan-African Banks - Opportunities and Challenges for Cross-Border Oversight\", Ecobank has maintained that it has addressed the issues raised by the IMF, including the introduction of processes and corporate governance structures or reforms. The report, it turned out, was dealing with matters between mid-2013 and early last year. The IMF admitted to this timing disjuncture and noted the steps taken by Ecobank to strengthen governance and avert risks to financial stability. The Ecobank has assets of more than $23bn (about R270bn). It raised about $1bn in combined equity and debt capital for its parent company and its business in Nigeria. This proves how easy it is to get facts mixed up in the rush of our desktop analysis, which would lead to undue destruction to the value of the assets of others. It also demonstrates how vigilant we must be as Africans to counter glaring media stereotypes. Toast of the week - caution beats bravado in Nigeria It is not what I would normally toast, but the decision by the Independent National Electoral Commission to postpone the elections in Nigeria from yesterday to March 28 was commendable in the circumstances. After the military had conceded that it would not be able to provide adequate security at polling stations, what other option was there? Following the spate of Boko Haram attacks across the country, the most dramatic might have been the attack by a woman suicide-bomber outside a stadium at which the incumbent president, Goodluck Jonathan, had just addressed an election rally. The woman detonated a car bomb, killing one other person and injuring eight. With seven days to to the original election date, the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission had expressed confidence that \"our level of preparedness, despite a few challenges, is sufficient to conduct free, fair and credible elections as scheduled on February 14 and February 28\". He even referred to the previous occasion, in 2011, that an election date had been postponed in Nigeria. Although the postponement has been called many names, including \"democracy deferred\", I find it rather prudent in the face of what Boko Haram has been doing and threatening. Since kidnapping schoolgirls from Chibok last year, the group has carried out attacks that have created an environment in which one would not feel comfortable to live, let alone do business. President Jonathan, unlike his opponent, Muhammadu Buhari, has supported the elections delay, while denying that he influenced the decision. This decision is my toast of the week, although I do not know if it will lead to the release of the Chibok girls before March 28 or the neutralisation of Boko Haram in Nigeria, parts of Chad, Cameroon and Niger. It is better to delay a process such as this one than to forge ahead with chutzpah when the military is pleading helplessness in the face of insurgence. May March 28 come and go swiftly, so that Africa can get its largest economy entirely back in action. Lest we forget: a focus on snippets of African history and icons for inspiration Liberia and Cameroon both celebrated important holidays on February 11. Liberia celebrated Armed Forces\\' Day on this date. The country was founded in the early \\'0s, mainly by freed slaves, modelling itself much on the US. This is why its capital, Monrovia, is named after the fifth president of the US, James Monroe. This year, the day marked the 57th Armed Forces Day and 106th year of existence of the Armed Forces of Liberia, with the theme for celebrations being \"Enhancing the capacities of the Armed Forces of Liberia to meet contemporary challenges\". Liberia is continuing to deal with the aftermath of a long civil war, although it has progressed a lot under the leadership of Africa\\'s first elected woman head of state, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. You may also know Liberia for its football star-turned-politician, the only African to have won the African, European and World Footballer of the Year awards. George Weah is a senator, having lost his bid for the presidency in 2005. In Cameroon, February 11 was celebrated as a national holiday called Youth Day to persuade the country\\'s youth to embrace education, sports and other cultural and creative activities, instead of violence. One of the greatest icons of Cameroon is saxophonist Manu Dibango, 81, whose music style and song Makossa influenced the refrain \\'Mama-se, mama-sa, mama-co-sa\\' in Michael Jackson\\'s hit Wanna Be Starting Something. n Kgomoeswana is author of Africa is Open for Business, anchor of CNBC Africa\\'s weekly show Africa Business News, and anchor |of the daily show Power Hour on PowerFM.

      "Speaking at a seminar on The State of the Nation at the University of Johannesburg, political analyst Aubrey Matshiqi made two strikingly insightful observations about the nature of public discourse in South Africa. He observed that the public discourse is under the grip of an \"echo-tower syndrome\", a situation where prominent people repeatedly engage on issues affecting those on the ground, without the actual knowledge or experience thereof. His second observation was that South Africa\\'s public discourse is broken into two polar opposites. The one is ultra-pessimism and the other ultra-optimism. Essentially, it is a conversation between two blocks that either sees doom or the best picture. What is required is to reflect on the situation in the country and determine which areas of success need consolidation and which need improvement. The ANC is on record as having said the strategic advances of the ANC government are obscured from the public eye by the heap of negative, vitriolic and personalised commentary that dominates national discourse. This can distort the government\\'s performance and present a false picture of the legacy of both the ANC government and President Jacob Zuma as the head of state. Without denying there are areas of weakness that require more work, much positive progress has been made. The Presidential Infrastructure Co-ordinating Commission (PICC) is a broad strategy of improving the state of our country\\'s infrastructure as well as pursuing economic development and job creation. It is disaggregated into 18 strategic integrated programmes (SIPs); the major projects under its umbrella are already under way and are incrementally contributing to job creation in various regions and economic sectors in our country. The long-term strategic collective output of the projects under the PICC will be the improved access |for South Africans to health-care facilities, schools, water, sanitation, housing and electrification, among others. Attached to this is the fact that increased investment in public infrastructure assets such as roads, ports, housing, schools, health-care facilities and water will lead to economic growth with expanded job creation underpinning it. Among these infrastructure interventions are initiatives such as the recapitalisation of transport assets under the transport cluster. Billions of investment in the initiative of locally assembling locomotives has begun to yield jobs and is geared to increase its yields in the long term. Furthermore, investments in broadband infrastructure have been made in an effort to improve our technological capabilities and efficiency in connectivity. This is exemplified by the international undersea cable that was started three years ago. It is meant to contribute to an increase in broadband capacity, linking South Africa and Europe and providing the state with the ability to provide broadband infrastructure to national projects such as the Square Kilometre Array. Some of these key infrastructure projects are related to energy provision, the area of great concern in the country owing to the recent shortages of energy supply by Eskom. These energy shortages are a consequence of an unbalanced relationship between the demand for power and the capacity of our energy utility to deliver a matching supply. Of course, the overriding cause for this is the dramatic increase in demand owing to the connection of vast numbers of households from the historically marginalised sections of our population. Apartheid energy infrastructure was imagined and designed to service a fraction of the population within the context of the racist social engineering of the former regime. Immediately after the fall of apartheid, the democratic government had, and has a moral obligation, to provide such services to the population, resource limitations notwithstanding at times. Thus, the need for electricity provision upstaged the maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure needed to keep up with the demand. The long-term negative spin-offs of this equation have been visited on all of us. This predicament is not manifesting without efforts to mitigate it. The government has articulated a mega-energy infrastructure project which is intended to provide a long-term power supply solution. This is within the context of consolidating an energy-sources mix that will ease pressure on the national grid and sustain the national energy resources over generations. In this regard, the government has embarked on a massive build programme to boost electricity generation through numerous projects that include the construction of the Medupi, Kusile and Ingula power stations. Once completed, the Medupi and Kusile facilities will be the fifth- and fourth-largest coal-fired power stations in the world, respectively. They are critical interventions in the area of energy utility and their effect is not short-term and thus can only be reflected upon properly in the long term. All these initiatives point to a strategic foundation for development that is being laid. Some are already bearing fruit and some have long-term progressive returns. Thus, the true legacy of the ANC government, as laid by Zuma, becomes clear when these initiatives are brought into play in public engagements, and will properly be accounted for in the long term as all their positive returns take effect. The pessimistic attitude towards the government and state of affairs in the country robs observers of the opportunity to appreciate these strategic efforts and only helps to reinforce repugnant sentiments of racism and a general distrust of a black government. n Masina is the ANC Ekurhuleni regional chairman and the Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry.

      "When world-renowned trumpeter Hugh Masekela, who is also widely known as Bra Hugh, relaunched his book, Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela at the Fort or Number Four, it might have baffled many of the event\\'s guests. The Fort at Constitution Hill in Hillbrow is a former prison known for its notoriety, incarcerating political activists during the height of the apartheid era. Figures such asNelson Mandelaand Mahatma Gandhi were among the guests of the former apartheid regime there. Notorious gangsters were also imprisoned at the Fort. It has now become a popular place with tourists after being turned into a heritage site. But what connection does Masekela have with the Fort since he was not among the political activists who once served time there, nor was he a gangster? Masekela in fact has every connection with the Fort or Number Four, and hence the relaunch there of Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela this week. The book, which sketches Masekela\\'s life from his humble birth in Witbank, a coal mining town in Mpumalanga then known for its harsh treatment of African migrant workers who were made to work in slave-like conditions, to his life in Springs and then the colourful and yet gangster-infested Alexandra township, was first published in the US in 2004. Then only 5 000 copies of the publication were shipped to South Africa . They sold out quickly and unfortunately the rest of us lost the opportunity to follow the colourful, and yet sometimes tragic life and the musical career of one of the country\\'s favourite and talented musicians, who had to leave South Africa in 1960 to pursue a musical dream first in London and later in New York, and in a way unshackle himself from the tight grip of the apartheid system. Publisher Jacana Media now has the licence from an American publisher to publish the book in South Africa, and hence the launch at the Fort on Tuesday. The choice of venue for the launch could not have been a better one as far as Masekela\\'s colourful life is concerned. \"We got off the bus at a shopping area of Rosettenville called The Hill, and walked down Third Avenue towards St Peter\\'s, a cloistered campus, comprised mostly of African students, set in the middle of an all-white, working class, racist neighbourhood... There was excitement all over the school grounds. Rose-Innes (a senior at the school and Masekela\\'s friend and neighbour from Alexandra) introduced me to his classmate Jerry Ntsipe, who adopted me on the spot and promised to watch over me,\" Masekela says in his book about his first day at this high school, which became a game-changer in his life as an aspiring musician in the 1950s. It is at St Peter\\'s that Masekela first met and befriended missionary Trevor Huddleston, who later on became instrumental in crafting Masekela\\'s musical career, and later facilitated his exit from South Africa for abroad where he spent more than 30 years in exile. \"Jerry took me to my dormitory, Number Four, the Fort,\" Masekela reveals his connection to the mystery Number Four he refers to in the book that he co-wrote with American journalist and media studies academic D Michael Cheers, who teaches visual journalism at San Jose State University in San Jose, California. In Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela, Bra Hugh opens up about his life for South Africa and the world to see, including his intense, sometimes on-and-off love life with the late South African jazz vocalist Miriam Makeba, his friendship with influential personalities and music figures, in South Africa, the African continent, as well as in the UK and US. In the book he also openly reveals his family\\'s life, traces his childhood back to the genesis of his passion for music in Mpumalanga through to the time when he was at St Peter\\'s, where with the help of Huddleston he became part of the Huddleston jazz band. It was Huddleston who gave him his first trumpet. He received his second instrument in 1956, from a man whose music he greatly respected, Louis Armstrong. He also revealed in the book how he met Makeba for the first time and how she immediately won his heart, a relationship and emotional link that would later consolidate into a marriage (they later divorced). It was Makeba and Harry Belafonte who were instrumental in getting Masekela to leave the UK in 1960 to go to the US where he won a scholarship to study at the prestigious Manhattan School of Music. Fast track this journey to a democratic South Africa and the role that Masekela continues to play in society with his music, and increasingly his outspoken nature: While his journey of drugs and debauchery and the U-turn he finally made and cleaned up is well-documented in newspapers and television programmes, it is his outspokenness on issues that often find traction with South Africans that has recently got especially women livid. For example, he recently triggered a public debate in newspapers, social media and radio stations when he said he would not take photographs with women who wear weaves, a highly emotive subject in South Africa as increasingly black women are mad about the weave, a multimillion-rand industry where some weaves cost as much as R10 000. The Sunday Independent caught up with Masekela at the launch and again revealed that wearing weaves is actually a mere symptom of what he believes are bigger, deep-seated issues afflicting African societies in post-colonial Africa, including in South Africa. \"I know I am outspoken on issues to do with heritage and who we are as Africans in post-colonial Africa, and sometimes my speaking out makes some people uncomfortable. \"The reality, though, is that the structures that were part of the colonial system are still there, including even seemingly harmless things like ceremonies. \"Our governments follow the colonial formalities in everything. Nothing has actually changed with regards to the system. \"And as Africans we are the only people in the world who like imitating everything, instead of becoming innovative and therefore globally competitive by taking our uniqueness to the world, exporting it, be it culturally or our unique identity,\" he bemoaned. He said that with regard to packaging our culture and heritage, which are rich, there is a potential to export this to the world. \"We live in a country and continent of paradoxes. For example, when tourists come to South Africa, they end up going to our national parks to look out for animals, and not us as a cultural entity. \"They look for us and they do not find us because we are not who we are. We try as much as possible to be something else, always looking to the West for cultural inspiration,\" he said. The trumpeter explained that when he left South Africa for the US, having been inspired by bebop, he initially wanted to play American jazz, just like the giants that he looked up to such as Armstrong, Miles Davis, Thelonius Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Charlie Mingus and Max Roach, to name but a few. \"But then, the very same musicians said to me, \\'Hugh, hold on. We want to hear you. If you want to play like us, then you will just become one of the statistics (of American jazz-version players). Instead, for you to become unique and successful, (you need) to play your (own) music.\\' \"I did that and ended up travelling the globe and playing my music all over the world,\" he said. He added that it was out of the context of his own experience as a musician playing his South African version of jazz all over the world that he speaks out about issues of heritage and identity and why it is important for Africans to remain themselves and not cultural imitators of other people. He revealed that he is passionate about rekindling the spirit of promoting African culture and heritage to the extent that he has now formed a cultural heritage foundation to promote these ideas. \"However, I cannot be presumptuous and stand arrogantly out there and say I am out to teach the nation about these values. \"I am here today because I am a product of this country. \"What I am doing is to give back to the country what the country gave me in the first place. As a musician, you cannot afford to be arrogant because once you do that you are finished,\" he declared. Masekela, who turns 77 in a few months\\' time, has over the years emerged as one of the most hard-working musicians. Besides his globe-trotting schedule performing, he still has time to get involved in other projects. In recent years he penned Songs of Migration, a musical about the history of migrant labour, which performed to critical acclaim at the Market Theatre in Joburg, before heading overseas for a season. Currently, Bra Hugh is shooting a television comedy show, Bantu Hour (See Life supplement), in which he plays the role of co-executive producer and co-host with funnyman Kagiso Lediga.\n",

      "SO MANY potatoes, so little time is a mantra worth repeating when you visit Newtown\\'s The Potato Shed. Opened in late 2015, The Potato Shed is housed in the historic building (from 1911) that was once Joburg\\'s potato shed, serving the city\\'s vegetable market in Newtown. Trivia buffs: should seek out the railway tracks running alongside the restaurant\\'s outdoor deck to impress your friends. This is a slick urban sister restaurant to the Life CafÃ© brand usually found in malls, designed and produced by Maira Koutsoudakis and team who are known for innovative leisure-inspired architecture and interior designs. It\\'s a great location. Next door is the fabulous local design emporium Work Shop New Town; across the piazza Newtown Junction Mall (with plenty of secure covered parking) and City Lodge Newtown Hotel (think city weekend getaway), a short walk along the paved avenue is The Market Theatre. But back to the potato. As the centrepiece of this eatery\\'s menu the spud shines. From whirly triple- fried chips and wood-oven roasted potatoes to slashed and stuffed spuds, crispy potato skins, string fries, mashed potatoes and even an aloo pakora battered mustard mash bread, it\\'s veritable potato porn. And enough to make Banting diet advocate Dr Tim Noakes apply for a court interdict. The menu here shows great attention to detail and a real desire to tantalise the taste buds. There\\'s plenty of the expected served in delightfully unexpected ways, like the bunny chow filled with pulled pork or Jozi beef, some pickled fish or a selection of vegetable pickles from the restaurant\\'s \"Curing Room\". Meat dishes from the fire pit are designed for large appetites and include a 1kg fire-pit poker of lamb on the coals with oregano, lemon and garlic and a 1kg hot chicken poker spiced in Mozambican \"pele pele\" style. Portions are large enough to satisfy a flock of hungry miners and it is advisable to eat here with people who enjoy sharing their food. Perhaps send a questionnaire to friends before you book. In keeping with The Potato Shed\\'s steam-punk-BBQ- smokehouse-bootlegger-hideaway inspired interior is a celebration of some industrial age cooking methods. We didn\\'t get to try dessert, but they looked suitably decadent, especially the Fire on Ice blow-torched meringue chocolate ice cream with black cherries, confit oranges and chocolate cake.There\\'s a fine drinks selection, a wraparound bar and a party atmosphere on the outside deck on weekends. Finally, Newtown has a good pre-theatre dinner attraction. â— This review appears in the city guide, Johannesburg In Your Pocket. Seewww.johannesburg.inyourpocket.com\n",

      "Come to this homely Afrikaans \"plaaskombuis\" or \"farm kitchen\" in Northcliff for bulging plates of traditional tuisgebakte (homemade) bobotie, kaas jaffel, vetkoek, skilpadjies and maalvleis. If you don\\'t know what these things are, ask for an English menu and prepare your stomach for a mammoth meal. Traditional Afrikaans cuisine, or Boerekos, is rich and hearty and has never been known for small portions. The Bergbron Plaaskombuis pays homage to the South African flavours of chef and owner Johan Smith\\'s childhood, particularly the traditional boerekos that his grandmother used to cook. It\\'s the kind of unpretentious and good value comfort food you\\'d more typically find far from a big city like Joburg. The cafÃ© is set out just as you might find at a farm kitchen in many small South African towns. A long, shady stoep or veranda, lined by window boxes filled with herbs, occupies the entire side of a single-storey building which overlooks a small garden nursery. There\\'s a padstal or farm shop selling local home-made jams and preserves, and a soaring steel wind pump stands guard at the entrance. Everything on the menu is home-made on the day according to time-honoured recipes handed down through Johan\\'s family. There\\'s Tannie (Auntie) Una\\'s deeply flavoursome lamb stew, Tannie Bessie\\'s filling chicken pie and Oupa (Grandpa) Andries\\'s sausages spiced with cayenne pepper. Even the bread is freshly baked on site each morning and if you arrive at the right time you\\'ll be treated to the sight of trays of fluffy fresh scones emerging from the old-fashioned coal-fired oven which sits on the veranda. Service is warm and friendly and guests are greeted with a small glass of refreshing gemmer bier (ginger beer) on arrival. So popular is this home-made ginger beer that Bergbron reportedly sells up to 75 litres of the stuff on a weekend day. There\\'s also moerkoffie on the stove on weekends. Made by simmering coarsely ground coffee for several hours, the coffee gets stronger as the day goes on until it reaches pure rocket fuel strength. Breakfast is served all day and options include the sonop jaffel (sunrise toastie) with fried egg, bacon and cheese, putu pap (crumbly maize porridge) with maalvleis (minced meat) or a classic cooked breakfast with all the works, served in rustic enamel plates. This is great way to start another busy day in the big city. l This review appears in the city guide, Johannesburg In Your Pocket, available in print, online and as a digital app. Seewww.johannesburg.inyourpocket.com.\n",

      "LAST Sunday, we embarked on an adventure: we took the steam train to Stellenbosch and it was delightful. Twice a month, Atlantic Rail chuffs off to the winelands with a locomotive built in 1926 pulling wood-panelled coaches almost 100 years old. They date from 1918 to the 1930s. The crew on board are members of Friends Of Atlantic Rail - all volunteers who do this in their spare time for the love of old trains - and they are more than happy to tell you more if you are interested. I am a sucker for statistics so learning it takes five to six tons of coal and 10â€†000 litres of water for the trip was right up my alley. \"We assist Atlantic Rail in operating their trains,\" Stefan Andrzejewski, one of the friends since the organisation was founded six years ago, told us. \"We currently have 72 members, 45 of whom are active.\" It was a dismal day but the rain did not dampen our spirits. We arrived at the appointed time and place - the Train Lodge - and found our seat in what was once a dining car. Other accommodation is in two-or four-person berths, the â€¨kind you would have slept in â€¨once upon a time. In the bar coach you can get tea, coffee (the milk is in one of those retro lidded turquoise Tupperware jugs all our grannies had) brightly iced cupcakes and hard tack. We gasped when we found there was no wine, but my friend had cleverly packed a tiny hip flask filled with a fine single malt Scotch, which saved the day. The trip out of Cape Town is not terribly scenic for much of the way, to be honest, but simply being on the train was good enough for us as we clapped our hands in glee. The first stop was near Vredenheim, where some passengers got off for their day on the wine farm. We continued to Stellenbosch, where we were allowed about three-and-a-half hours to entertain ourselves. A quick Uber into the centre of the town deposited us at hustling and bustling Schoon, where I had once had a cup of thick chocolate which I have never forgotten. Sadly, they don\\'t make it anymore, and I had to make do with hot frothy milk and chocolate buttons. From there we strolled around, browsed in an art gallery, bought jewellery and a beaded spectacle case, then looked for somewhere for lunch. Just as the heavens opened for a serious and prolonged downpour, we slid into the last available table at Man\\'Oushe, seduced by the Johnny Cash they were playing. Sadly, this later broke down into Lebanese pop music but it was time to go anyway; the bottle of Graham Beck Railroad Red - which could have been specially made for us that day - had been depleted. Next stop was Brampton Wine Studio to get supplies for the home journey. If you are ever in Stellies and looking for good reasonably priced wine - as in cellar door prices - this is where you should go. A bottle of OVR (Old Vine Red), a Bordeaux blend, is only R67. l For more information, upcoming trips and how to book, go to â€¨www.atlanticrail.co. za, emailinfo@atlanticrail.co.za, or call 021â€‰558â€‰5805.\n",

      "SITUATED on the top floor of Rosebank\\'s newly opened Trumpet building, Marble restaurant has distinct polish and finesse. It was a warm Monday evening and, with its being my friend\\'s birthday the following day, I was delighted to find that, unlike many restaurants, acclaimed chef David Higgs\\'s newly established Marble was open. As a starter, we shared a plate of spicy chicken wings. Basted in a thick and particularly spicy sauce, they were a bit too peppery for my friend, but I thought they were just right. Blackened octopus and overnight coal-roasted soup are among the other intriguing starter options. On the waiter\\'s advice, I ordered the pork neck and my friend a well-done sirloin steak. My pork neck came with a lovely grilled pineapple, jalapeÃ±o syrup, remoulade and pork crackling. I also ordered fries as a side. The sirloin came with a spinach and mushroom salad, roasted cauliflower, and fries. My friend found himself regretting ordering his steak well done as it was a bit tough to chew and bland on the taste buds. My pork neck on the other hand was tender and delicate, the pineapple and jalapeÃ±o syrup giving it a palatable sweetness. Other mains include rib-eye steak, prawns, and lamb cutlets. Marble embraces South Africa\\'s unique braai heritage by employing a wood-fired grill, with the chefs preparing food on an open fire in the exposed kitchen. The fire burns cleanly, with barely a puff of smoke. Despite its selection of salads, Marble is distinctly meat-focused. After the filling portions of our mains, we shared an ice-cream sandwich - almond meringue with halva ice cream. It wasn\\'t mind-blowing, but it served as a delicate and sweet taster. Other dessert options include a passion fruit parfait and a strawberry concoction with burnt strawberries, pistachio creme, ash meringue, and a Greek dessert of nut-and-honey pastry rolls, kataifi. With its wood and marble decor, Marble is a smooth blend of sophisticated and down-to-earth dining. It will soon be opening a boutique butchery offering some of the cuts available in the restaurant. After dinner, my friend and I retreated to the bar area to cap off our evening with drinks. Situated in its own sleek and elegant corner, this contemporary bar has a completely different feel from the restaurant. A huge glass-encased wine rack with a few dozen wine and champagne bottles stands between the main area of the restaurant and the bar. The bar has its own menu, with a unique selection of bites and a wide variety of cocktails. A mixologist is on hand to mix any drink of your liking from the wide range of mixers available - we enjoyed trying out a few drinks, including the fiery hand grenade shooter. The neatly decorated terrace looks over Joburg\\'s starry skyline, providing a glittering view and is an ideal place to hang out. When I come again, this is where you\\'ll find me.\n",

      "In 1966, three pupils performed a music item for their schoolmates during a bursary fundraising event. Sipho Mabuse remembers that performance at Orlando West High School in Soweto with a sense of achievement, as well as joy and gratitude for the support he has enjoyed from South Africans and the world. He describes 2016 as a remarkable year, which witnessed amazing shows to mark his golden jubilee. However, he has dedicated 2017 to more special concerts to celebrate his milestone achievements in the industry. The multi-instrumentalist\\'s five decades in the industry were defined by unwavering commitment and a pioneering contribution to South African music. Among his numerous landmark achievements he lists producing Miriam Makeba\\'s platinum-achieving album, Welela (1989), as well as performing alongside Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and Baaba Maal at the 46664 concert for Nelson Mandela in New York. Born Sipho Cecil Peter Mabuse on November 2, 1951, in Orlando West, he has distinguished himself as a versatile musician who has played everything from township disco to jazz. Mabuse\\'s seminal recordings set the tone for the Afro funk and Soweto soul era in the late 1960s and spearheaded the golden decade of township pop in the 1980s. Born into a musical family, his father, a coal merchant, played harmonica. Baba Manuel, a neighbour and traditional healer, influenced his love of drums. His greatest influences included Early Mabuza, Gordon Mfandu and Gerald Khoza - all of them top drummers in the history of South African jazz. \"One of my fondest memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life was when I was 14 and Early Mabuza walked into the studio and asked to sit on my drum kit to practise,\" he recalled. Mabuse was playing drums as a member of his school\\'s cadet band when he was spotted by fellow pupil, Selby Ntuli. Together with a schoolmate and bass player, Alec \"Om\" Khaoli, they formed The Beaters. Guitarist and keyboard player Ntuli was the band leader until his death in 1978. Their creative and original music became the soundtrack of the black consciousness movement. It was called Soweto soul. \"There was a void our music filled,\" he said. \"It served a much higher purpose, which was to mentally emancipate black people from a feeling of passive helplessness into a world of strength through song. \"We were all the sons and daughters of Africa, working on our strengths to take what we did to another level. As scary as those dark days were through the 1970s, strangely I remember them with fondness.\" The Beaters listened to a wide variety of styles, which included The Manhattan Brothers, Miriam Makeba, The Ink Spots and foreign artists such as Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley, Otis Redding and Jimi Hendrix. Their first album, Soul-A-Go-Go, was released in 1969, a year after the band\\'s formation. Bacon and Eggs (1970) and Mumsy Hips (1971) followed later. In 1975, Mabuse and Khaoli joined pianist Pat Matshikiza and the great altoist Kippie Moeketsi in a studio as members of the rhythm section for a recording of Tshona, an album that became one of the popular classics of South African jazz. \"As a young musician I had a high regard for Bra Kippie because he was an incredibly talented musician who has raised the profile of South African jazz. \"We met at a time when he was a very angry and disgruntled musician who felt that his talents had gone unappreciated by South African society. During the Tshona sessions his mastery of the alto sax was clear, and we decided to feature him on our next album, Rufaro (1978).\" In 1976, they toured the then Rhodesia. What was intended as a three-week visit became a remarkably successful three-month tour. On their return they released an album, Harari, as a tribute to the people of the township of the same name outside Salisbury, the capital. It inspired the band\\'s name change to Harari. The band attracted some of the country\\'s hottest guitarists, Funky Masike Mohapi, Saitana Ndimande, Doc Mthalane, Condry Ziqubu and Zimbabwean-born Louis Mhlanga. Seasoned jazzmen like Kippie Moeketsi, Themba Mokoena, Barney Rachabane, Dennis Mpale and Stompie Manana also featured on Harari albums. In 1978 Hugh Masekela invited Harari to the US, but Selby Ntuli\\'s death robbed them of the opportunity to go. Mabuse effectively became the band\\'s new leader. Highlights of those years included supporting and backing Percy Sledge, Timmy Thomas and Brook Benton during their South African tours. They were all impressed with Harari\\'s incredible musicianship. In 1979, they became the first black pop group to appear on SABC TV. The following year they became the first black group to headline their own show at the Colosseum, a landmark music venue in Joburg. In the same year they were featured in a BBC documentary. They were the aristocrats of South African pop. Heatwave (1980) was released in America. Party (1982) entered the American Disco Hot 100 charts. At the pinnacle of their career in 1982, Harari disbanded - its members pursuing solo careers or forming new bands. Mabuse retained the name and used it to nurture young talent. Future stars like Chico Twala and Kamazu were part of the new youthful Harari. His other project at the time was the Soweto Soul Orchestra, which involved 40 musicians - something unheard of among black artists at the time. In 1983 he launched a groundbreaking solo career as Sipho \"Hotstix\" Mabuse - the nickname he was given by fellow musician Condry Ziqubu because of his hot style of drumming. His debut album, Rise (1983) sold an incredible 132â€¯000 copies. \"The break-up of Harari on the threshold of an international breakthrough was the most heartbreaking experience for me, second to Selby\\'s passing. I needed an emotional lift. Rise became that lift,\" he explains. Its successor Burn Out (1984) made recording history with half a million units and stayed on top of the charts of every radio station for weeks. It was a crossover hit that captured every South African across the racial divide. The album changed the texture of Afro pop and township jive like no other song or artist in local pop history. Burn Out also became an international multiplatinum phenomenon. The artist signed a R1.5â€¯million deal with Virgin Records to have it released in the UK. It was also released in Germany, Japan and the US. The CBS deal in the US placed him in an elite stable of international superstars like Michael Jackson and the Rolling Stones. The success of Burn Out made him one of the most sought-after performers at concerts and festivals in Europe. His next album Afrodizzia (1986) underscored his newfound status as a world-class performer with global acclaim. Produced by Virgin Records, it reached platinum status within three weeks of its release. The album\\'s single, Shikisha, became such a monster hit the album was sold as Shikisha for the European market. It is a soundtrack on Throw Momma from the Train (1987), the American comedy film starring Danny de Vito, Billy Crystal and saxophonist Branford Marsalis. Chant of the Marching (1989) features Miriam Makeba and was banned on SABC radio. What About Tomorrow (1991) and Township Child (1996) are among the albums he released under a free South Africa. An artist of many parts, Mabuse has also produced albums for other top South African artists including Hugh Masekela, Miriam Makeba, Ray Phiri and Sibongile Khumalo. In the early 1990s he made his mark in radio broadcasting when he presented jazz shows on 702 Talk Radio and Metro FM. In the mid-1990s he took over Kippies as the popular Joburg jazz venue\\'s manager. During his tenure he hosted international superstars like Stevie Wonder, Jonathan Butler, Al Jarreau and Thelonius Monk jr. In 2011 he celebrated his 60th birthday in style when he finally obtained his matric certificate - having attained pop stardom as a schoolboy made it impossible for him to finish his studies. \"There are so many more wonderful stories, through my 50-year-long pilgrimage, that have made this ride truly extraordinary.\" At 65 he is convinced he still has a critical role to play in the South African music scene. One thing is for sure. Mabuse has already created an outstanding legacy in South African music. Mabuse will celebrate his golden jubilee when he shares the stage with Freshlyground for the first time at Spier Amphitheatre, Stellenbosch, on March 25 between 6pm and 9pm.\n",

      "WHEN Ben Ngubane was South Africa\\'s ambassador to Japan from 2004 to 2008 his counterparts from other African states told him about lucrative business opportunities in the oil and gas drilling sectors in the western parts of the continent. Ngubane, a former KwaZulu-Natal premier who resigned under a cloud this week as chairperson of Eskom, told The Sunday Indepen-dent that at the end of his tour of duty in Japan he returned home and motivated to explore these mining opportunities. His interest was concentrated on the Central African Republic (CAR), where he had been told gas and oil were in abundance, and drilling opportunities were freely available. The former IFP leader, whose name features prominently in the leaked Gupta e-mails relating to state capture, and also in the then public protectorThuli Madonsela\\'sState of Capture report, confirmed that he and businessman Salim Essa, a Gupta associate, travelled to the CAR in 2013 to strike a deal. Ngubane said Essa had been keen to partner with him. \"The plan was to go to West Africa and to buy oil blocs. Another company from India was going to drill these blocs - and we were going to sell the oil for huge sums of money.\" He said Essa had arranged a trip to the CAR for March 2013, with the Guptas having made a private jet available to them for the journey. \"But then we decided not to go,\" said Ngubane. The trip was called off because of the civil war that was raging in the CAR at that time, he said. \"I said to him: \\'We can\\'t go there. We cannot get involved in that part of the world. It is too unstable and too dangerous\\'. That\\'s where the talks ended,\" Ngubane said. He complained that his critics were now using his relationship with Essa as a stick with which to beat him, accusing him of being a Gupta ally. \"Now I am told a copy of my passport is with the Guptas. That is nonsense,\" he said. But he nevertheless believed the Gupta family were being unfairly discriminated against by \"white capital monopoly\". He was scathing about Madonsela\\'s report, describing it as \"a creation to try to bring down any black company or person wanting to enter the area of commerce that white companies dominate\". \"Any business persons, as long as they do business legally, are above board and accountable to the legislation of the country and to the regulatory authorities, can do business in South Africa. As black people, we must also be allowed to enter that space,\" he said. Even after resigning, Ngubane said he and members of the Eskom board were still being subjected to an investigation by the parliamen-tary portfolio committee on public enterprises. This comes as the DA raised concerns that Ngubane\\'s resignation should not exonerate him from liability for the breakdown of gover-nance at the power utility. DA spokesperson on public enterprises Natasha Mazzone said Ngubane still had much to answer for as his resignation came \"hot on the heels of damning revelations of the capture of Eskom leadership by the Guptas, and the breakdown of corporate governance at Eskom\". \"Ngubane, who presided over the retrenchment/retirement/re-hire of Brian Molefe as Eskom CEO, has much to answer for, not least of which includes (Brian) Molefe\\'s R30-million \\'golden handshake\\' deal and an avalanche of accusations that the Guptas have milked Eskom over many years,\" Mazzone said. \"Ngubane\\'s resignation will not exonerate him from liability for the breakdown of governance at the power utility, and the DA will use the parliamentary inquiry into Eskom, set to commence on June 21, to hold Ngubane to account.\" Mazzone said allegations by former mineral resources minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi that Molefe and Ngubane had tried to strong-arm him to withdraw Glencore\\'s Optimum mining licences in order to guarantee that the Guptas would take over Glencore\\'s coal mines had yet to be probed. So did the alleged Matshela Koko R1-billion nepotism scandal, which Mazzone said happened on Ngubane\\'s watch.\n",

      "ON NOVEMBER 3, Standard Bank senior political economist Simon Freemantle published a report, The prospects for and implications of an NDZ win. The format in which the report is written is calculated to make it appear at first glance as if it is objective. However, the further one reads the more the mask of academic pretence drops and questions arise. The research is weak and shallow. It appears to be mostly a cut-and-paste job from biased newspaper articles that were written as anti-Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma smear pieces. One cannot help but wonder why a senior political economist would produce such shoddy work. Was Freemantle under pressure from his employers at Standard Bank to deliver a document that could be used to de-campaign Dlamini Zuma? Was he given instructions on what the conclusions of his so-called research should be? This flimsy document certainly has all the appearances of Freemantle abusing his academic credentials in order to create the fake impression of academic objectivity, while it is a piece of biased pseudo-academic propaganda. Is the report really intended for Standard Bank clients? It purports to be for internal use only, Standard Bank and its clients - and not for public distribution - but within hours after it was internally released, it was posted in PDF format all over social media networks. A concerted effort was made to distribute it as widely as possible and to reach the biggest possible audience. Not only does the document display all the traits of a propaganda piece, but the manner in which it was distributed - with the clear intention to reach and influence the widest possible audience - also seemed like propaganda. As far as \"servicing the client base of Standard Bank\", the report must be seen as of little value to the clients since it is based on hardly any scientific grounding for business forecasting. For example, regardless of the outcome of the ANC\\'s national elective conference next month, the rating agencies might downgrade South Africa. It is a fact that Moody\\'s and Standard & Poor\\'s will decide not only on their biased political interpretations, but also based on international economic trends, which the government has little control over, to downgrade South Africa. Markets are well aware of this and have started to factor that into their planning. Freemantle refers to the narrative of \"fiscal downslide\" if Dlamini Zuma wins. However, in contrast to the leaked recommendation of the Heher Commission on free tertiary education, that it is not feasible from an economic/fiscal perspective, Cyril Ramaphosa in his campaign - similar to the strong position Dlamini Zuma has taken in favour of free quality education - has indicated that \"students need free education\". This is in contrast to the leaked findings of the commission that it is not affordable. It must be noted that the commission\\'s finding is controversial, that it is disputable and needs further research and political consideration. It is certainly not a \"proven economic fact\" that free tertiary education will lead to a fiscal downslide. Despite being a senior political economist, Freemantle ignores this and in a biased manner treats it as a so-called fact. He uses this to argue that her strong policy position in favour of free quality education will lead to a fiscal downslide. Furthermore, he uses the narrative that policies \"such as this will deliver a message to the market of political and patronage continuity, rather than the decisive economic and institutional re-gearing\". The fact is that radical economic transformation goes back to the initial, Freedom Charter-based, commitment of the ANC for a fundamental restructuring of the economic relations in favour of the majority (especially black people), with \"re-gearing\" being a necessity to ensure long-term political stability in the country. To argue that Dlamini Zuma will specifically deliver an unpalatable message to the market is simply an opinion of Freemantle and those he represents; it is not at all based on market dynamics. In fact the markets would like to maximise profits. Dlamini Zuma\\'s policies in favour of radical economic transformation will maximise profit and efforts towards poverty alleviation. Freeman\\'s main arguments can therefore be criticised as follows: 1. \"The damaging preservation of the status quo\": Radical economic transformation is not the status quo. This is a fact Freemantle ignores. Radical economic transformation will prevent South Africa from sliding into political instability. In September the latest statistics showed the untenable poverty situation in the country - facts Freemantle ignored in his interpretation. Furthermore Ramaphosa also indicated that the \"land question\" must be resolved. Freemantle ignored this fact. Somehow Freemantle argues that the markets would prefer Ramaphosa. This is not based on any scientific study. Furthermore, he does not acknowledge that markets will always protect imperialistic outcomes and will try to postpone maximising poverty alleviation. The question should be asked: is this sustainable? How long can that be maintained before a downslide to political instability and violence? 2. \"Public Sector wage increases\": The fact is that Cosatu opposed Ramaphosa\\'s views on the national minimum wage. Ramaphosa\\'s election will not necessarily render the negotiation process with trade unions less complex. To argue in this way makes it a biased opinion, with the intention to promote Ramaphosa as Standard Bank\\'s preferred candidate, not based on any scientific argument. 3. The rationalisation of key state-owned enterprises: Ramaphosa said recently that \"we cannot just throw away SAA\". The fact is that even if he wins, he will not rationalise key SOEs as Freemantle indicates. Freemantle\\'s \"selective sale\" of state assets is more complex than indicated and it is not ANC policy. To what extent will Cosatu and the Federation of Unions of South Africa accept this? 4. Nuclear: Nuclear is not a one-year project as nuclear expert Chris Yelland indicated; it is a 10- to 12-year project. Who can say with certainty that enough electricity will be available in 2030? Is coal and diesel sustainable to generate electricity? These arguments do not form part of the report. Thus they must be seen as opinions. Against this background Freemantle wrote a report based on his own opinions and guided by CR17 campaigners and Standard Bank\\'s bias in favour of Ramaphosa\\'s candidature. This report was never meant to be an \"academic piece\" to objectively be of service to Standard Bank clients. It is hardly of any academic or scientific value. It is cheap propaganda that deserves to be consigned to the rubbish bin. Standard Bank and its senior political economist should be ashamed of themselves for intervening in this manner in the internal politics of the ANC and for trying to influence the outcome of our national elective conference. Fortunately they have done it in such an amateurish and ham-fisted manner that it was from the start doomed to fail dismally. n Niehaus is a former member ANC NEC member and an Umkhonto we Sizwe veteran.
