    "#### Similarity check for duplicates identification\n",
    "Here the approaches for similarity checks are explained:  https://spotintelligence.com/2022/12/19/text-similarity-python/. I first did the similarity analysis in R, but had much longer computation times. I also compared the perfomance (i.e which articles detected as duplicates) and it turned out to be identical. \n",

      "ONE HOUR. As little as R50. A hi-tech copier that has watermarking capabilities. And a stamp. This is all that is needed to create a fraudulent document on the streets of Joburg. From a matric certificate to a sick note, a school promotional report or a transfer letter, you could buy anything from R50 to R1 500. While a transfer letter would cost R50, a school report is a mere R100, R150 gets you a sick note and R1 500 can buy you a matric certificate. And while the fraudsters do not advertise, they have a market and word of mouth is their marketing tool. The Sunday Independent tested how easy it is to obtain fraudulent documents. In one week we were able to secure a report, a transfer letter, a matric certificate and a sick note. But the documents failed an authenticity test - authorities rejected them. Our journey starts in Zola, Soweto. My role is that of a teenager\\'s mother. The story is simple: my son has failed Grade 10 and I want him to be promoted to the next grade. I meet a man who claims to have been in the business of selling reports for years. His office is his four-room house, his storage unit an old coal stove. A school report and a transfer note would cost me R150. He takes out an old plastic bag. Inside is a greasy old envelope. In the envelope is his bread and butter - copies of different formats of school reports and transfer letters. The reports and transfer letters are from Trinity High School in Lenasia, south of Joburg. He asks the child\\'s name, date of birth, grade and what he wants to study. He hands over a piece of paper on which I must write the \"perfect\" grades that would leave no doubt at any school that \"my son\" deserves to be enrolled there. He neatly writes the information on the school report. \"My son\" passed Grade 10. He got good marks - 60 percent for accounting and 72 percent in life sciences. The minimum pass mark on the report is 40 percent. Pity he failed mathematics. He got 38 percent. The remarks, supposedly written by the class teacher, are: \"Well done, keep it up!!!\" He takes out a Trinity High School stamp and seals the deal. He says he got the stamp from someone who works at the school. \"Are there not going to be any comebacks? Are you sure my son is going to be admitted at any school with this report,\" I ask. \"Relax, my sister. My stuff works. I can even accompany you to the school,\" he assures me. Later I learn the school has never had such a stamp. Meanwhile, I ask for the transfer letter. He looks in his envelope and realises he has run out of transfer letters. He instructs us to drive to the nearest internet cafe where he says he will type one. He packs up his documents and puts them back in the coal stove. At the internet cafe, the man asks for a piece of paper. He drafts the \"testimonial\" and hands the piece of paper to an assistant to type. \"My son\" and I wait in the car while he goes to a tavern next to the internet cafe. He has had three beers by the time we leave the internet cafe. Back at his \"office\", I notice a spelling error in the transfer letter, but he is drunk and I can\\'t reason with him. I tell him I will be back the next morning for a corrected version. He agrees and tells me I must call him before I arrive. \"I don\\'t like being woken up in the morning,\" he says. The man claims that he makes R2 000 to R3 000 a day from fake reports, especially in January. The next morning when I return, I also ask for a sick note as I was supposedly absent from work the previous day. This was after I learnt that he also makes sick notes. He gives me two days off. I pay him R60. The sick note and stamp are from Tladi Clinic, Soweto, where, the man claims, he has an insider. He tells me that the money he makes from sick notes is his \"petty cash\". His \"serious\" money is from selling reports. But his assuring words that his fake documents are legitimate turn out to be false. The Sunday Independent took the documents to Trinity High School, where principal Calvin Baloyi was shocked at the revelation. \"I just can\\'t believe this,\" said Baloyi. From the moment Baloyi saw the report, he said the school stamp and the letterhead on the report and the transfer letter were not the ones the school used. He said the school reports were not handwritten and each grade received reports on different-coloured paper. Grade 10 reports were, for example, on pink paper. The only things the fraudster got right were the school address and its telephone number. All the school\\'s reports have the Gauteng Department of Education\\'s logo and the school logo. The fake one has neither. The school stamp also has the details of the provincial Education Department. The only things that are handwritten on the original school reports are the signatures of the class teacher and the principal. Baloyi joined the school last year, but was adamant that the school had never had a stamp like that before. An administrator who has worked for the school for years showed The Sunday Independent the school\\'s old stamps. None looked like the one on the fake documents. The transfer letter was also not the same as the one the school uses. When a child comes from another school, explained Baloyi, the new school requires a profile of that child from the old school. If a school were to call looking for the profile of \"my son\" at Trinity High School, the school would not have it. To check this, The Sunday Independent went to a school in Soweto to see if the report would work. The administrator immediately picked up that it was a false report. He agreed with Baloyi that school reports were not handwritten. Moreover, a final-year report had all the pupil\\'s results from the first term to the fourth term. The fake report only had the last term\\'s results. Gauteng Department of Education spokesman Charles Phahlane,said fake reports had no value. He said it was also not easy for pupils to transfer to another school unless they are moving from Grades one or eight. Phahlane said even then, principals, from the new school would phone the previous school to find out the history of a pupil and would be made aware if the pupil failed or has a fake report. To add insult to injury, I was left with egg on my face and R210 less in my pocket. I visited Tladi Clinic to verify if the stamp on the sick note was indeed from the clinic. It turns out the clinic lost its stamp years ago, and it was likely that the one on the fake sick note was the clinic\\'s own stamp. \"How can we get this stamp back? We really need it,\" asked one senior nurse. The clinic now uses a stamp that it is supposed to use when nurses visit schools. The officials said they did not know how the stamp got lost, but said they ruled out any possibility that it was stolen by a colleague. Instead they thought a \"clever patient\" might have stolen it. The stamp was never reported missing, in the hope that it would re-surface. Three nurses, who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, confirmed that the sick note was different from the one used at the clinic. I found, however, that security guards at a local clinic in Soweto were also selling \"legitimate\" sick notes. So the journey continues to the Lillian Ngoyi Clinic. The first security guard tries speaking to a clerk to organise a sick note for my colleague and me. But she comes back saying the clerk is \"scared\". She asks us to try the next gate and speak to the security guards there. One word to the next security guard and we are promised a sick note. He quickly runs to a clerk who has been smoking outside. The security guard later returns to ask for my details and how many days of work I have missed. \"Why did you miss work,\" he asks me. \"I was visiting my boyfriend and I missed work in Pretoria,\" I reply. My colleague and I pretend to be a couple. He later comes out of the clinic while we wait outside, with a message that two days would cost R150. Later, the security guard calls my colleague to join him in the men\\'s toilet. The exchange happens in the toilet. The security guard walks away with R150, while we leave with a brown envelope. It is that simple. The sick note ostensibly has a patient number, doctor\\'s signature and practice number and it indicates that the \"patient\" has been seen by a doctor. When I return to the clinic to notify the authorities about the business taking place there, I see the same security guard keeping watch at the gate. He doesn\\'t recognise me. In the clinic I am told by senior managers that whoever wrote the sick note for me forged a doctor\\'s handwriting. I ask the managers, who did not want to be named, how the person could have known the doctor\\'s practice number. \"These people are clever; they might have seen it somewhere and memorised it.\" But The Sunday Independent confirmed that the practice number on the sick note was not valid. A practice number consists of seven digits and the one on the sick note only had six. A practice number consists of seven digits and the one on the sick note only had six. Lynette Swanepoel from Board of Healthcare Funders,the board responsible for issueing practice numbers to doctors, also confirmed that it was not a valid practice number. Swanepoel said the board gets quarries all the time about fake sick notes. She said the most common one was of receptionist who still doctor\\'s script pads and sell sick notes without the doctor\\'s knowledge. \"It\\'s a huge scam,\" she said. Even though the Gauteng Department of Health said it was not aware of the scam, it had a harsh message for those who have turned clincis into businesses. Spokesperson for the department, Simon Zwane, said the department would investigate the fraud; if the matter is \"proven beyond reasonable doubt\" those involved will face the consequences. \"Any fraudster who uses Gauteng health and in particular Johannesburg Health District resources fraudulently will be dealt with decisively,\" he said. After buying sick notes and reports, I am convinced that money can buy anything. But there was still one more stop. My colleague and I meet the man who is going to sell us a matric certificate in Hillbrow. Our meeting is in a car. I come with a piece of paper with subjects and an ID number that would go on to the certificate. It would take me about an hour to get a matric certificate for \"my brother\". An hour, not 12 years of schooling. The man says sometimes it might take more than an hour to print the certificate as \"police sometimes come and we have to run\". He won\\'t disclose where he prints the certificates. \"Are you sure that my brother is going to get into university with the certificate?\" I ask the man. He tells me he has never done a certificate for someone wanting to go to university, but has produced a lot for people who want to go to colleges and some are working now. \"It\\'s top, top, top... It\\'s the same as the original. It\\'s got the Department of Basic Education and the Umalusi (the council responsible for issuing and verifying matric certificates) logo,\" he says. He says he uses special paper. He can also tamper with certificates, he claims. But if one is caught that the are using a fake certificate, the man says he can unfortunately not assit. \"It\\'s impossible to put it in the system. You can just hope that they don\\'t check the authenticity of the certificate,\" he says. I pay him and he promises to have the certificate ready in an hour. About an hour later, I have a matric certificate in my hand. From afar, it looks legitimate, but it\\'s not the real deal. Manager of certification at Umalusi Anne Janse van Rensburg spotted a number of security features that were flawed in the certificate. She said it was impossible to fake the certificate as the paper was imported and was not available in the country. First, she noted, the fake certificate was lighter compared to the heavier authentic certificate, which weighs 120g. The colours on the fake certificate were wrong and the fonts on it differed from the original one. The font sizes on the fake certificate were bigger too. \"Clearly it is a wrong certificate,\" said Janse van Rensburg. The fake certificate might fool employers or potential employers when photocopied, but it would not get past the gates of a university. According to Janse van Rensburg, universities received matric results electronically after the release of the results. Universities also required students to produce their original matric certificate and to leave a copy. But employers who don\\'t verify the authenticity of their employees\\' matric certificate with Umalusi or other agencies are at risk of falling prey to the fraudsters. Janse van Rensburg said the council often received requests to verify matric certificates from nursing colleges and the bank sector. Many private companies were also making use of the verification process. Even though Gauteng spokesperon for police, Lungelo Dlamini, could not provide numbers , he said police have made several arrests in Hillbrow and Yeoville of people dealing with fake documents. A man had been arrested last year for selling fake sick notes to students at the University of Johannesburg, while another man was also arrested in Pretoria for selling fake Matric certificates for R2000, he said. \"Any person found in possession of the fake documents faces charges of fraud, forgery or dealing with fraudulent documents. Punishment is imposed by the courts,\" said Dlamini. My mission was accomplished. The conclusion? In Joburg, money can buy you anything. But you can also waste it on worthless fakes. - additional reporting Dumisani Dube Bongekile.macupe@inl.co.za\n",

      "Article 117:\n",
      "Forget the State of the Nation address, worry about how to address the problem of a nation in a state over red overalls, jammed signals and riot police in the National Assembly. The EFF, led by Julius Malema, former leader of the ANC Youth League, did not care that this address marked the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Freedom Charter. That nonchalance is curious, considering that the expulsion of Malema from the ANC can be traced, among other things, to his persistent calls for the nationalisation of mines, in line with the provisions of the Freedom Charter. The red berets were not interested in President Jacob Zuma\\'s quoting recent StatsSA figures that 15.3 million people were in employment. They were not there to listen to him share his administration\\'s nine-point plan to create jobs, including: the beneficiation of mineral wealth and the dedication of 30 percent of the public procurement budget to supplies by SMMEs, co-operatives and township enterprises. His commitment to giving Eskom R23bn in the next fiscal|year, and the expected long-term 15 000 megawatts that could come from the Grand Inga hydropower project, did not strike a chord with the party that has brought more action to Parliament than any other in the history of South Africa. He could have promised them the world. They would not have believed a word. To them, the president is not \"going to come back... but disappear after the State of the Nation address\". In Malema\\'s words, the \"man cannot be trusted... he must resign\". Lesson? People in power, be careful what sort of youth you raise in your ranks. Condemn their actions when they insult others to make a point while they are among your ranks. If you do not, they will turn on you when they run out of people to affront and, while they are at it, reduce the State of the Nation address to a freak show of water cannon and scuffles. After all, how long before mining is truly transformed? The fracas that preceded the address obliterated from memory the biggest mining show to come to town, a few blocks from Parliament. Thousands of delegates spent three days networking, discussing and making deals in mining. Minister of Mineral Resources Ngoako Ramatlhodi did his best to reassure investors that the mining sector was becoming more attractive. In his address, Zuma reiterated that the monitoring of compliance by mining companies with the Mining Charter was continuing. Of more interest was his decision to refer the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act back to Parliament because of its perceived constitutional shortcomings. Among the key criticisms of the act was the concern that its proposed designation of certain minerals as strategic resources might be in violation of South Africa\\'s obligations to the World Trade Organisation\\'s stipulations. A week ago in Addis Ababa, the AU recommended that Africans find sustainable ways to manage the continent\\'s resources, including beneficiation and adding of value to minerals. Backtracking on the declaration of certain minerals as strategic reflects a lack of the resolve in dealing with an issue that is holding Africa back. We export raw minerals cheaply and import the same minerals in a processed form. Investors prefer certainty. They would rather receive the bad news, deal with it and move on, than legislative and policy processes that in the end skirt the issues. The slump in commodity prices can only mean a rise in private equity deals in mining this year. While those looking for mining assets to buy are excited by their prospective finds, the interests of the communities affected by African\\'s mining activities remain pegged to the vagaries of the international prices of resources over which they have no control. It is time South Africa took a stand on this matter once and for all. Gold in Namibia, graphite in Mozambique, and what with the South Sudanese prospects? Events such as the mining indaba this week tend to raise all sorts of unlikely headlines about the industry. Even as South Sudan is making headlines for its attempts to make something out of the power-sharing deal, I read reports that its Minister of Foreign Affairs, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, was at the Cape Town International Convention Centre talking about mining in his country. A country that is 98 percent dependent on oil has to find alternative sources of revenue, more so when its leadership crisis and squabbles with its northern neighbour make it hard to generate oil revenues. Apparently, before his fallout with his deputy, President Salva Kiir had been visiting Arab countries to raise investments for the sector. In his position, I would first rush to restore leadership and parliamentary order to Juba before talking about mining in Cape Town, but then maybe that is why Kiir is running South Sudan, and not me. Two countries that had every reason to be at the indaba to talk about mining were Namibia and Mozambique. Both have held fairly peaceful elections, their economies are growing at a reasonable pace and they have an impressive record of attracting mining investments. I had mistakenly associated Namibia with only uranium and diamond mining. The headline that impressed me was about an investment by a Swedish jeweller, Kristallen, in a gold refinery in the country. This pleased me, but mostly Namibia\\'s Minister of Trade and Industry, Calle Schlettwein, who expressed a need for his country to have its own gold refinery, although it might not have enough gold to refine. There are only two gold mines in Namibia, the Navachab Gold Mine in the Erongo region and the Otjikoto B2Gold Mine in Otjozondupa. No wonder the Namibian property market has been in non-stop growth mode for five years. Tanzania is expecting a slowdown in production and Zimbabwe is continuing to punch below its weight on the mining front, but Mozambique is making new finds in its north. An Australian company, Mozambi Resources, announced last week the signing of its option to acquire two graphite licences in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. One of these areas is reportedly near Triton Minerals\\' Nicanda Hill - considered the world\\'s largest-known deposit of graphite and vanadium. As if the coal and gas were not enough for the land of Eduardo Mondlane and Samora Machel, investors keep on streaming in. Watch out for this future hub of southern Africa! IMF on Ecobank: are we cool? South Africa has two main investors in the pan-African bank, Africa\\'s largest by footprint, the Ecobank Transnational Incorporated or simply Ecobank. These are the 20 percent shareholder, Nedbank, which paid R5bn for its stake in the Togolese-registered bank in October. The other is the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), with an 18 percent stake. A week or so ago, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised the concern that the aggressive growth by the bank posed governance risks. Subsequent reports even extended the story of the risk to the entire continent. I found that rather alarmist. Ecobank had tackled the corporate governance issue, including the dismissal of its then-group chief executive officer, Thierry Tanoh, who sued for defamation and unfair dismissal. To equate whatever governance issues there have been at Ecobank to a continent-wide crisis is a tad dramatic. The problem is that institutions like the IMF have a huge following and influence. A lot can go wrong before appropriate public relations\\' interventions can restore the confidence of the investing public in the company or country concerned. Since the publishing of the report \"Pan-African Banks - Opportunities and Challenges for Cross-Border Oversight\", Ecobank has maintained that it has addressed the issues raised by the IMF, including the introduction of processes and corporate governance structures or reforms. The report, it turned out, was dealing with matters between mid-2013 and early last year. The IMF admitted to this timing disjuncture and noted the steps taken by Ecobank to strengthen governance and avert risks to financial stability. The Ecobank has assets of more than $23bn (about R270bn). It raised about $1bn in combined equity and debt capital for its parent company and its business in Nigeria. This proves how easy it is to get facts mixed up in the rush of our desktop analysis, which would lead to undue destruction to the value of the assets of others. It also demonstrates how vigilant we must be as Africans to counter glaring media stereotypes. Toast of the week - caution beats bravado in Nigeria It is not what I would normally toast, but the decision by the Independent National Electoral Commission to postpone the elections in Nigeria from yesterday to March 28 was commendable in the circumstances. After the military had conceded that it would not be able to provide adequate security at polling stations, what other option was there? Following the spate of Boko Haram attacks across the country, the most dramatic might have been the attack by a woman suicide-bomber outside a stadium at which the incumbent president, Goodluck Jonathan, had just addressed an election rally. The woman detonated a car bomb, killing one other person and injuring eight. With seven days to to the original election date, the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission had expressed confidence that \"our level of preparedness, despite a few challenges, is sufficient to conduct free, fair and credible elections as scheduled on February 14 and February 28\". He even referred to the previous occasion, in 2011, that an election date had been postponed in Nigeria. Although the postponement has been called many names, including \"democracy deferred\", I find it rather prudent in the face of what Boko Haram has been doing and threatening. Since kidnapping schoolgirls from Chibok last year, the group has carried out attacks that have created an environment in which one would not feel comfortable to live, let alone do business. President Jonathan, unlike his opponent, Muhammadu Buhari, has supported the elections delay, while denying that he influenced the decision. This decision is my toast of the week, although I do not know if it will lead to the release of the Chibok girls before March 28 or the neutralisation of Boko Haram in Nigeria, parts of Chad, Cameroon and Niger. It is better to delay a process such as this one than to forge ahead with chutzpah when the military is pleading helplessness in the face of insurgence. May March 28 come and go swiftly, so that Africa can get its largest economy entirely back in action. Lest we forget: a focus on snippets of African history and icons for inspiration Liberia and Cameroon both celebrated important holidays on February 11. Liberia celebrated Armed Forces\\' Day on this date. The country was founded in the early \\'0s, mainly by freed slaves, modelling itself much on the US. This is why its capital, Monrovia, is named after the fifth president of the US, James Monroe. This year, the day marked the 57th Armed Forces Day and 106th year of existence of the Armed Forces of Liberia, with the theme for celebrations being \"Enhancing the capacities of the Armed Forces of Liberia to meet contemporary challenges\". Liberia is continuing to deal with the aftermath of a long civil war, although it has progressed a lot under the leadership of Africa\\'s first elected woman head of state, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. You may also know Liberia for its football star-turned-politician, the only African to have won the African, European and World Footballer of the Year awards. George Weah is a senator, having lost his bid for the presidency in 2005. In Cameroon, February 11 was celebrated as a national holiday called Youth Day to persuade the country\\'s youth to embrace education, sports and other cultural and creative activities, instead of violence. One of the greatest icons of Cameroon is saxophonist Manu Dibango, 81, whose music style and song Makossa influenced the refrain \\'Mama-se, mama-sa, mama-co-sa\\' in Michael Jackson\\'s hit Wanna Be Starting Something. n Kgomoeswana is author of Africa is Open for Business, anchor of CNBC Africa\\'s weekly show Africa Business News, and anchor |of the daily show Power Hour on PowerFM.

      "What the crystal ball holds for the new year From elections and infrastructure to sizzling shares on the JSE, 2014 promises to be a bumpy ride A priority will be to get the first unit of Medupi on line. This would bring another 800MW onto our sputtering grid Some of Transnet\\'s R307-billion to be spent over the next seven years until 2021, will come into play this year The JSE\\'s Top 40 index continued to climb on the first day of the year, reaching a record 41482 points LIGHTS ON, OR OFF? ESKOM CEO Brian Dames will step down at the end of March. His successor has not been named, but Transnet\\'s Brian Molefe is regarded as a strong contender. Whoever is in charge, the priority will be to get the first unit of Medupi on line. This would bring another 800MW onto our sputtering grid. Work on the power station is still not going smoothly, with the latest French contractor, Alstom, likely to be replaced with Germany\\'s Siemens. The first unit of Kusile - Medupi\\'s Mpumalanga twin - is due to be active by the end of the year, but do not hold your breath. The rest of the units in Medupi and Kusile are meant to come online at eight-month intervals until completion in 2018. The Ingula hydropower station in the Drakensberg, the third of Eskom\\'s mega-power projects, is expected to be completed only in March 2015. Six construction contractors died at Ingula when a platform collapsed in a tunnel in October. Keeping the lights on will be the big challenge this year. Any delays will place Eskom under pressure and could lead to emergency cutbacks to big users, as was the case for three days in November. Eskom, which was granted another 8% tariff increase, has warned that supply will be \"very constrained\" from this month. POLITICAL POWER FROMThuli Madonsela\\'sNkandla report, expected this month, to Julius Malema\\'s fraud and corruption trial in September, it will be a busy year. But all is expected to be overshadowed by the general election, probably between April and May - and whether the ANC will get 60%-plus or less. Events leading to the election start next weekend when the ANC launches its election manifesto in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. This is expected to be the ANC\\'s toughest battle since 1994. The ruling party goes into the election carrying the burden of a scandal-prone leader and is in its weakest position since democracy. Although the DA is unlikely to win support from the black middle class - the constituency it has been targeting - it appears to be in a better position that the ANC. Its flip-flopping on affirmative action may benefit the ANC and new parties such as Malema\\'s Economic Freedom Fighters and Mamphela Ramphele\\'s Agang SA. But with a good premier candidate in Mmusi Maimane, the DA is expected to make gains in Gauteng. Parliamentary debates should be more interesting with the presence of EFF and Agang in the National Assembly after the elections. NEW LESSONS TWO issues will dominate education this year: the implementation of the revised Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS) syllabus in Grade 12 and the piloting of African languages for all pupils. This year\\'s matrics, as well as pupils in grades 7 to 9, are the final batch to switch to the revised curriculum. CAPS is the government\\'s policy statement for learning and teaching. It replaced the outcomes-based education system. The revised syllabus was introduced in grades R to 3 and Grade 10 in 2012, and in grades 4 to 6 and Grade 11 last year. A big advantage is that subject content is specified, giving teachers the confidence to teach and test pupils. It is aimed at equipping pupils with skills to identify and solve problems and make decisions using critical and creative thinking. One of the implications of CAPS is that all matriculants have to study two official languages, maths or maths literacy and life orientation. At least 25% of a pupil\\'s mark in Grade 12 will come from school-based assessment tasks and tests, and 75% will come from exams. This year\\'s Grade 12 pupils will be the first to write an exam based on the revised syllabus. The teaching of African languages will be piloted among grades R and 1 pupils at 860 schools. LAYING DOWN TRACKS SOME of Transnet\\'s R307-billion, to be spent over the next seven years until 2021, will come into play this year. This massive project will expand ports, pipelines and railways. The rail expansion is to carry more coal, iron ore and manganese, as well as building and upgrading wagons and locomotives. A priority is building a line from the coalfields in the Waterberg to Eskom\\'s power stations in Mpumalanga. Transnet says a third of the money will be raised from external sources. In November, Transnet became the first South African company to list a rand-denominated bond in international capital markets, successfully raising R5-billion in London. The challenge is to complete projects on time and within budget. Transnet\\'s multiproduct fuel pipeline from Durban to Gauteng has been running three years behind schedule and R10.7-billion over budget, almost doubling its original price tag of R12.7-billion. The second phase is set for completion early this year. UP IN THE AIR AT LEAST three new low-cost airlines are jostling for local airspace, and SAA\\'s turnaround strategy - begun in earnest last year - will likely continue with route cuts, hook-ups with other airlines in code-sharing agreements and a focus on regional flights into the rest of Africa. Low-cost carriers Fastjet and FlySafair were virtually yanked off the runway as they tried to get onto the lucrative and under-supplied Cape Town-Johannesburg route. Fastjet retreated to its base in Tanzania and kicked off dirt-cheap regional flights, but FlySafair is likely to make a fresh takeoff bid this year. Skywise, the yet-to-be-seen airline created by the founders of the flawed 1time, is another possible entrant in the market. Last year Pakistani consortium Pak Air emerged as possibly the latest saviour of the 1time brand, and hopes to be in the air by March. But we have heard this all before. SAA chief executive Monwabisi Kalawe has been trying to make the overweight behemoth self-sufficient. Already, loss-making long-haul flights have been scrapped, and hook-ups have been formed with other airlines in code-sharing agreements in South and North America. This year, you can expect new regional routes into Africa, possibly annoying Fastjet, which is aspiring to be a fully African operation. Labour disputes can also be expected as the duplicated operations of SAA and subsidiaries Mango and SA Express are consolidated. CHEAPER TALK WITH luck, South Africa should start to experience the benefits of Telkom\\'s promised focus on fibre-optic broadband this year. Meanwhile, leadership at Cell C will change this year. CEO Alan Knott-Craig suffered a \"minor\" stroke in November, and chief commercial officer José dos Santos took over, but some reshuffling is a given. Market share will probably trend upward as termination charges - the costs paid by one network to another when calls are made between service providers - were changed to favour the little guys, Cell C and Telkom Mobile. Knott-Craig has long said that Cell C needs to tie up with another entity - Telkom Mobile and FNB were named - to drive market share. Such a marriage is on the cards. Rumours swirled at the end of the year that Vodafone was considering buying out the 35% shares in Vodacom it does not already own. Then Orange, China Mobile or AT& T were said to be looking at buying Vodafone\\'s 65% stake. Although such a major change is possible, Vodacom\\'s purchase of Neotel seems more likely. But this depends on whether Neotel gets to keep its state-bestowed spectrum. If so, Vodacom might end up bidding against major international players seeking a toehold in Africa. MAKING MONEY THE Johannesburg Stock Exchange\\'s Top 40 index continued to climb on the first day of the year, reaching a record 41482 points. On the same day, the All Share index, which is a weighted index of all the listed shares, was up to 46131.29 points. One of the best-performing sectors on the JSE in 2013 was large-cap industrials. According to a report by Geoff Blount, CEO of Cannon Asset Management, the sector is almost a stand-alone market in terms of size and performance. It is composed of companies such as BAT, SABMiller, and Richemont. According to the report, it would be the most expensive \"market\" in the world if measured separately from the other shares listed on the JSE. There are, however, still relatively cheap stocks to be had this year in this sector: •Steinhoff: Low valuation (11 times price-to-earnings ratio), plus a diversified earnings geography make this manufacturer and retailer of furniture the stock to watch; •Sasol: A weakening rand, combined with a steady oil price and cheap valuation (10 times PE), make this rand hedge a potential big gainer this year; •Anglo American: New management, a greater focus on sweating assets and a lower price to net asset value means the stock has space to run in 2014; •Kumba expects results for the 12 months ending December 31 to show 20% higher earnings compared with those of the 2012 period; and •BHP Billiton has undergone a management reshuffle, write-downs have largely been completed and it offers a much lower price-to-book valuation. Bonds had a reality check and foreigners made fewer net purchases last year than in 2012 or 2011. According to Futuregrowth portfolio manager Wikus Furstenberg, this trend of softer demand translates to potentially better returns this year. \"The market looks better in terms of valuation compared with last year. Twelve months ago, we were far more bearish on the local bond market simply because the market had repriced to some extent. \"Both inflation-linked and fixed-coupon bonds did worse than cash in 2013. I think yields generally were too low - both markets began the year at low and overpriced levels, and we\\'ve seen a correction,\" Furstenberg said. THE WINNING FEELING THERE will be a full sports buffet on the table, with something for every spectator to savour. The usual annual starters of international tennis, golf, football and F1 fare will be served, and the sports scene will take off with the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. It will stage 98 events in 15 winter sports. The recent bomb blast at the Volgograd central train station has raised security concerns, but the Russians are adamant that the show will go on between February 7 and March 23. The Commonwealth Games will follow in Glasgow from July 23 to August 3, when 6500 athletes from 70 countries will compete in 17 sports. But the main course of this year\\'s sports cuisine will be served in South America where the spotlight will shine on the samba land from June 12 to July 13. The Brazilians want nothing more than to see their five-time world champions add a sixth star above their badge when they host the greatest sporting spectacle on earth, the 2014 Fifa World Cup. In spite of the flames of public protests off the field, Brazil had a dream dress rehearsal in July and were sizzling hot when Luis Felipe Scolari\\'s men bossed Spain to lift the Confederations Cup. The pressure is on Big Phil, assisted by former Bafana Bafana coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, to repeat the feat. Each has conquered the world - in 1994 and 2002 - and Brazil is a nation of high expectations. ROAD TO SAFETY SOUTH Africa may have a road network of only about 750000km, but it ranks among the worst when it comes to road fatalities. But the time for relying on \"prayer and God\\'s mercy\" to keep road deaths down is past. Two weeks ago, Transport Minister Dipuo Peters said prayer and \"God\\'s hands of mercy\" were needed for road safety because the government\\'s road-safety campaigns had become ineffective in reducing accidents and fatalities, especially during the festive period. Several interventions aimed at producing more competent drivers are likely to start taking shape this year. These include the introduction of a new driving licence system, whereby all new drivers will get only provisional driver\\'s licences for 12 months. Drivers on probation who commit six traffic offences in a year face having their licence suspended. They may also have to go back to driving school and start all over again. The draft National Road Traffic Act regulations, which were gazetted for comment, were drawn up to regulate driving schools. In addition, the regulations are intended to ensure that vehicles older than 10 years are tested for roadworthiness every two years. The 2013 festive season resulted in more than 1200 deaths on the country\\'s roads, a figure that is likely to rise as holidaymakers head home before schools reopen. - Jana Marais, Tina Weavind, Tshepo Mashego, Prega Govender, Bareng-Batho Kortjaas and Isaac Mahlangu\n",

      "FIVE WOMEN, MANY FLAVOURS Two decades ago, compiled the cookbook Tastes: Thoughts on South African Cuisine. Five chefs featured in the book tell us how their thoughts and tastes have changed in 20 years of democratic cooking FIVE WOMEN, MANY FLAVOURS YVONNE SHORT Chef and Pick n Pay Food specialist South Africa has fantastic chefs, who use local, seasonal produce, care about the wellbeing of livestock, manage waste and the environment, support small businesses and of course local farmers and artisan suppliers. Their passion for food spans cultures and leads to friendships and connections based on mutual respect and appreciation (and celebration) of creative talent. For the past 20 years, I have been privileged to be part of this wonderful, exciting food adventure. The information age has contributed to the democratisation of cooking, so to speak. We are surrounded by cooking shows, websites, magazines and books that bring the wondrous world of food into our homes. Everyone with a TV and a designer apron can be a master chef. Our choice of ingredients is now endless. Twenty years ago we couldn\\'t buy Danish Viking Smoked Sea Salt or bamboo-roasted sea salt. Our wine cellars are now filled with luscious balsamic elixirs infused with truffles, figs, cherry and mango. We can choose the colour purple for carrots and the length of the stem for broccoli. Which makes dragging out and resurrecting old recipes and cooking methods even more exciting and fabulous. Twenty years ago I made this grilled goat\\'s cheese wrapped in banana leaves. It feels even more relevant today, as African flavours continue to inspire us. GRILLED GOAT\\'S MILK CHEESE IN BANANA LEAVES 2 banana leaves 200g goat\\'s milk cheese Pinch of lemon pepper Pinch of dried origanum Olive oil, for drizzling Wash leaves in hot water. Divide the cheese into two rounds and place each on a banana leaf. Season with pepper and origanum and drizzle with oil. Fold the leaf over, wrap tightly and tie with raffia. Grill or braai on medium coals until leaves are slightly charred. Open leaf and eat the cheese with grilled fruit, such as quince. Serves 2 SUZI HOLTZHAUSEN Chef owner of Gaaitjie restaurant in Paternoster, West Coast In the last 20 years I have gone from teaching to operating a restaurant. I guess it meant putting my money where my mouth was. Having moved from the African heartbeat of Gauteng to the West Coast nine years ago, my flavour use has mellowed. I use only touches of earthy spice. It is a special experience to cook for visitors to Paternoster. People who travel are adventurous, willing to try unfamiliar ingredients and flavour combinations, plus they are relaxed, which makes for the ideal customer. Being in a small country village forces you to use local, sustainable fresh produce. On the food trend scene, thankfully, the foam is finally off the plate and back in the sea! Twenty years ago I described South African cuisine as a \"tinned fruit salad - colourful but nothing standing out\". I have realised (and I still don\\'t know why) that each tin of fruit salad only ever contains one cherry. In South African cuisine, that \"cherry\" has become much more valued. We care about how and where our food is grown, whether it has a festival in its honour, how far it travelled to make it into the tin. We prefer it fresh and picked in season, we recreate how grandma used to prepare it, taking us to a place of comfort. We look into how it was first used, when it arrived in our history. We replant the stone and watch it grow. And we are starting to care what happens to the tin. Orzo (pasta rice) is still one of my favourite ingredients and a great stand-by. In winter, I add it to fish broths and waterblommetjie bredies. AFRICAN ORZO RISOTTO 100g green lentils, soaked in water overnight and drained 200g canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained 3 coriander seeds 1 clove 1 stick of cinnamon 2 cumin seeds 2 paprika peppers 15ml (1 tbsp) sesame oil 1 onion, finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic, chopped 10ml (2 tsp) grated fresh ginger 1 fresh red chilli, seeded and chopped 100g orzo (pasta rice) 1 x 400g can chopped Italian tomatoes 30ml (2 tbsp) finely chopped fresh parsley Salt and freshly ground black pepper 200g chard or spinach, chopped and crispy-fried, to serve Yoghurt, to serve 1 red onion, sliced and deep-fried, to serve Place lentils in a pot, cover with water and simmer until tender. Drain and mix with the chickpeas. Place coriander seeds, clove, cinnamon stick, cumin seeds and paprika peppers on a baking sheet and dry roast for 10 minutes in a preheated oven at 190ºC. Grind to a powder in a spice grinder. Heat the oil in a pot and fry the onion until soft. Add spice powder, garlic, ginger and chilli and stir-fry for a minute. Add orzo and stir to coat. Add tomatoes, reduce heat and simmer until orzo is tender. Stir in the lentils and chickpeas and heat through. Add parsley and season. Serve with fried chard or spinach, topped with yoghurt and deep-fried onion rings. Serves 4 CASS ABRAHAMS Food consultant and author of \\'The Culture and Cuisine of the Cape Malays\\' Traditional South African cuisine will always be my passion, but as a chef I have become very fond of experimenting with new, healthier dishes. I have also become interested in exploring food from the field, especially the greens the khoi-san used. I would very much like farmers to start growing these plants, as I think it will add a fantastic dimension to our cuisine. My audiences today have a far greater knowledge of food and are more open to trying new tastes and ingredients, maybe because of the great variety of cooking shows on TV and the abundance of new cookbooks. The number of men attending cookery classes has increased significantly. And as more young women become professionals, but still want to cook and eat food their mothers and grandmothers made, there has been increasing demand for classes that teach traditional home-cooked food. When I started introducing Cape Malay cuisine to a broader audience, I was dismayed at the lack of spice knowledge among the white population, who were severely disadvantaged by apartheid. Things as common as allspice and tamarind were completely foreign to them. That has changed and Malay cuisine, once regarded as exotic, has taken its rightful place in South African culture. I still make masala fish exactly the same way as I did 20 years ago. The only concession I have made is that if it is served in a restaurant, I recommend fish with very few bones. At home we make it with snoek - because it is served with roti and eaten with the hands, we are able to easily remove all the bones. MASALA FISH 30ml (2 tbsp) coriander seeds 30ml (2 tbsp) cumin seeds 10 garlic cloves 2 green chillies 10ml (2 tsp) salt 15ml (1 tbsp) masala mixed spice 5ml (1 tsp) ground turmeric 1kg snoek or other firm fish, cleaned and cut into 6-8 cutlets 45ml (3 tbsp) oil 3 medium tomatoes, thickly sliced Juice of 3 lemons Pound coriander and cumin seeds with garlic, chillies and salt in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder. Add masala and turmeric and mix to form a thick paste. Rub paste into fish cutlets and leave for 15 minutes. Heat oil in a pan and fry fish for 6-8 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Set aside to keep warm. Fry tomatoes in same pan. Place fish on a serving platter, sprinkle with lemon juice and top with tomatoes. Serve with rice and sambals. Serves 6-8 DORAH SITOLE Food consultant and author of \\'Cooking from Cape to Cairo\\' As a nation, we have always been very accommodating of food from other cultures. We tend to embrace it faster than we do our own cuisine. But South Africans are becoming much more willing to try new ingredients and flavours. All the new food markets are testimony to that. I\\'m thrilled to see the growing numbers of young black people at these markets and at food shows. There is a much more relaxed attitude towards food than there was 20 years ago. People are having more fun in the kitchen, hence the blogging craze. More young people - especially men - are finding cooking an exciting hobby. The internet has made it easy to access any recipe and TV food shows have become a trend. Women are far more respected in the SA hospitality industry today, thanks to chefs like Margot Janse, who keep winning major awards, and the many food writers and stylists. There are more women executive chefs than there were 20 years back. It would be nice to see more representation in the executive committees of bodies like the SA Chefs Association. The chicken yassa I made 20 years ago is a national dish of Senegal, so I would be reluctant to interfere with it. The ingredients are easily accessible in SA. I have also made it with fewer onions, added coconut milk and fresh coriander, and changed the name to tangy chicken. CHICKEN YASSA 1 chicken, portioned Salt and pepper 15ml (1 tbsp) mixed masala spice 45ml (3 tbsp) oil 4 onions, sliced 80ml (& 8531; cup) lemon juice 1 fresh green chilli, chopped 500ml (2 cups) chicken stock 10ml (2 tsp) dried mixed herbs Season chicken pieces with salt, pepper and masala. Heat oil in a large pan and fry chicken until brown. Remove chicken and fry onions in same pan until golden. Add chilli, stock and herbs and cook for 5 minutes. Return chicken to pan, remove from heat and leave to marinate for 3 hours or overnight. Gently cook chicken in sauce on a low heat for 1 hour or until tender. Serve over savoury phuthu or rice. Serves 6 THERESA BEUKES Chef owner of Duchess of Wisbeach restaurant in Seapoint, Cape Town The most significant changes I\\'ve seen in the SA food industry over the past 20 years are: the organic food movement, the importance of food provenance, and, sadly, the enormous increase in food costs. I have stopped pushing food boundaries and gone back to refining classics. I have stopped twisting and tweaking my food. I am more fascinated by the honesty of food and nature. I find myself referring more to Elizabeth David than Ottolenghi. I have restaurant patrons who have been eating with me for 20 years. What has changed - besides their age - is that they have a heightened knowledge of and interest in food and are more aware of healthy food. Information technology has played a large part in quicker access to food information. I look forward to seeing more village markets and growth in the farmer-to-table movement. I am thrilled to see young, talented and extremely passionate South African chefs coming into this industry. Our SA food culture is still young, but food has become fashionable. We are exposed to TV chefs and food programmes which are informative and have captured our interest. I think we are still battling within our multicultural society to establish a South African cuisine. I see exciting menus which include unique South African products such as naartjies, guavas, waterblommetjies and biltong. I still make these bobotie spring rolls the same way, but instead of homemade chutney, I give the option of Mrs Ball\\'s chutney, one of SA\\'s unique culinary icons. BOBOTIE SPRING ROLLS 30ml (2 tbsp) butter 30ml (2 tbsp) olive oil 15ml (1 tbsp) grated fresh ginger 15ml (1 tbsp) brown sugar 7.5ml (1& 189; tsp) curry powder 7.5ml (1& 189; tsp) ground turmeric 5ml (1 tsp) salt 2 chives, sliced 500g beef mince 1 thick slice white bread, soaked in water and drained 50g (& 8531; cup) raisins, soaked in sherry or port (optional) 30ml (2 tbsp) chutney 10ml (2 tsp) apricot jam 10ml (2 tsp) white vinegar 10ml (2 tsp) Worcester sauce 15ml (1 tbsp) tomato sauce Handful dried apricots, sliced 80g whole peeled almonds, toasted 1 packet spring roll pastry (or use phyllo pastry) Oil, for deep-frying Heat butter and oil in a large, heavy-based pan and gently stir-fry ginger, sugar, curry powder, turmeric, salt and chives for 5 minutes. Add mince, bread, raisins, chutney, jam, vinegar, Worcester and tomato sauce, apricots and almonds and cook gently for 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Make double layers of spring roll pastry, or use 2 sheets of phyllo pastry cut into 15cm strips. Place 60ml ( cup) of mince mixture into the centre of each strip. Fold in the ends and roll up in a cigar shape. Heat the oil and deep-fry spring rolls until golden brown. Drain on paper towel.

      "\"We don\\'t care about Gucci and Prada. We just want delivery eKasi,\" says a Wesselton resident after four days of heated, violent protests in the township near Ermelo, Mpumalanga. It is Friday morning and he is one of scores of young, unemployed men walking the streets. The anger in his voice is palpable. He spits the words \"Gucci\" and \"Prada\" out, referring to the penchant for fine things ANC politicians have acquired in their years of power. The man, who identifies himself only as Nkosinathi, believes he will probably chastised and perhaps even killed for speaking out against the ruling party. This is Mpumalanga, after all. \"I\\'ve been receiving threats. People are telling me we are on a hit list because we are anti-revolutionary and anti-ANC. We are not anti-ANC. These are the very same issues that confront the communities of other areas. We want decent water, toilets and jobs. But (those other communities) are living in fear.\" Residents of Wesselton say they are no longer afraid. They faced off against police, some of whom used live ammunition, and most have lived to see the next day. One \"comrade\" has died. Solomon Madonsela has become a martyr. What simmers here is an anger that has turned into a resolute decision: we will not accept this; we deserve better. The signs of their struggle are not contained to one section of the sprawling settlement. Destroyed traffic lights, Telkom public phones, burnt containers and the tell-tale black smear left by burnt tyres can be seen throughout the area. Where there are no tyre marks, stones and glass are scattered on the road and pavement. Nkosinathi spends his time with other angry young men. Some would call them militant. They are fiercely political. The call each other \"comrade\" and say they are fierce ANC supporters, but in the same breath vow not to vote for the ruling party - or anyone else - in the upcoming local government elections. Community leader Dumisani Mahaye says he will make the proposal to thee community at a meeting to be held tomorrow. Mahaye says the party, which has a majority of council seats in the Msukaligwa Municipality, should be \"grounded like an errant child\" by communities withholding their endorsement at the polls. \"The ANC has been promising for years. It\\'s been doing that since 1994. But it never lives up to its promises.\" Another \"comrade\" appears and joins the circle, saying the ANC\\'s approach doesn\\'t help, but arguing that the solution cannot be to vandalise state and private property. \"Hasn\\'t the community learnt anything after 15 years? You can voice your anger, but it\\'s wrong to damage property. When we are angry we can\\'t break things that belong to us,\" he says. Some nod in agreement. \"The ANC angers people because it doesn\\'t engage them.\" There is a suggestion that 50 percent of all local jobs be retained for residents, both at the surrounding mines and in the council. The circle is divided - some call for a 70 percent job quota for locals, while others say skills development is what\\'s really needed. Mahaye goes so far as to suggest that councillor salaries be scrapped and that money be used for skills projects. \"People don\\'t work because they are not skilled. Why not take the councillor salaries and build something that will help people? What do the councillors do? People don\\'t see them. Why should they get paid?\" And older resident overhears the debate and offers his opinion. Having lived in Ermelo for more than 40 years, Jeremiah Khumalo is just as frustrated as the young men. His gripe is with a seemingly inefficient and uncaring municipality, which, he says, has ignored a request for technicians to be sent to his home to repair a burst pipe. He takes us to his home, where water can be seen running from a hole in his driveway into the street. He scoops it out to show us the damaged pipe, explaining that he has reported it to at least three different people, including a clerk in the mayor\\'s office. Two months later, water still runs into the street. Several streets away we are shown another property that has lost a large portion of its lawn to a growing body of water. According to homeowner Moses Duma and several neighbours, council workers dug the hole \"and just left it\" in April. Residents say children regularly play in the dirty water after school. Even more disturbing is the electric cabling which runs beneath the hole. Duma says the hole was initially dug to fix a burst pipe. \"They keep promising: they are coming, they are coming. But they don\\'t come.\" His brother Collin emerges from the house and tells us that a child nearly drowned recently. \"The kids like to play in this water. I saw one of them nearly drown but I managed to get them out.\" Municipal spokesman Surprise Ngcongo said last week that the protests \"had nothing to do with service delivery concerns as greatly exaggerated in the mainstream media\". \"Msukaligwa Municipality did not receive any written memorandum from the |angry protesters relating to service delivery concerns.\" However not everyone in Wesselton is a \"comrade\", hellbent on facing off with the state - headed by a previous generation of comrades, who many believe have forgotten their cadres. At the small shopping complex that was the scene of violent clashes with police last week, we find Sibusiso Madi. Beside him are crutches; his foot is in bandages. He is not political, says he was not involved in protests, and just wants to return to work. Madi is one of few residents who are gainfully employed, but today finds himself sharing an uncomfortable set of steps with the many unemployed youngsters who walk the streets of Wesselton. \"I was on my way to work. I was coming to catch my bus over there (he points at a nearby bus shelter). The police didn\\'t ask any questions, they just shot at me. I had to run away.\" What\\'s worse, as a result of the protests, Madi was trapped in the burning township from Monday, when he was shot, until Thursday. \"No ambulance could come in. And the community wouldn\\'t let any cars in. I was prepared to pay R40 for a cab to go to the hospital. But they couldn\\'t come in,\" he says. As a result of the protest, he has lost out on the R1 600 he would have earned in a |fortnight doing construction work on the N17 highway. Selina Ngwenya is also just trying to get by. She sits on a pile of used coal, looking for pieces that can be used. She does not have electricity and uses the coal for cooking. \"Sometimes we spend the whole day doing this. We have to look for pieces that are big.\" She also took part in the protest: \"We want toilets, water and electricity.\" In Khayelihle, a new part of the township, none of the roads are tarred and there are a few green portable toilets in the area. We see about five taps placed throughout the shack settlement, and residents are seen walking back and forth with containers. A group of women, including Sibongile Khosi and Hlezipho Khumalo, complain that the portable toilets are often not collected for two weeks. They also believe the area needs more taps. Will Khosi vote this year? \"I won\\'t vote. Who will I say I\\'m voting for? How long have I been dirtying my ID book with stamps, going to vote? I don\\'t trust anyone.\"\n",

      "Despite denials and a brave face when addressing a hastily organised press conference, Malema and colleagues were betrayed by sombre looks at the realisation that the day of reckoning is imminent and spells only trouble for their political careers. But who will feel sorry for a fool who hauls hot coals over his own head. All talk about not being scared of a disciplinary hearing is empty rhetoric. Malema claims he cares about unity in the ANC, but his actions over the past three years tell a totally different story. Take his attacks on alliance partners like Cosatu and the SACP and his divisive singling out of Gwede Mantashe for slander and disrespect. Malema has created a gulf of suspicion between those in Government and those based at Luthuli house. He even tried to cause division in the Presidency by lobbying Kgalema Motlanthe to stand against President Zuma. Malema and company fully deserve what is coming their way.

      "Just six days out from the FNB Stadium showdown with the All Blacks, John Smit is closing in on his century of Test caps. Unlike the batsman in the nervous nineties he is sure to certain to reach three figures (unless the hamstring strain that kept him from training last week intensifies), but the match is shaping up to be as much a watershed as it is a milestone for the illustrious Springbok captain. Smit will not have been impervious to the growing clamour from disappointed fans that he is too old, too unfit and not suited to the direction in which the game is headed. He might even give it all a wry smile, shrug his shoulders and wistfully say to himself: \"Here we go again.\" Smit has been proving himself to the Springbok public for years now - he has variously been criticised as being inferior to Lukas van Biljon, Gary Botha, Schalk Brits and Bismarck du Plessis, but has always rolled up his sleeves at the coal face, seen off his competitors and then taken his game and the team to new heights. How will he respond in 2010? Smit is a champion and champions don\\'t like the feel of the canvas on their cheek. For Smit and the Springboks, this week\\'s match has so many similarities to the Battle of Bafokeng in 2006. Going into that savage showdown in Rustenburg, the Boks had lost five in a row - at home to France, three matches overseas in the Tri-Nations (including 49-0 n Brisbane) and then their first home match (45-26 in Pretoria). This year it is just the three defeats overseas, but another poor performance in losing to the New Zealanders will render life unbearable for the coaching staff and captain. Peter de Villiers probably does not understand that but Smit certainly does. He has journeyed into the Heart of Darkness and like Captain Kurtz of the Joseph Conrad classic, has seen \"the horror\". In 2006 it was common knowledge that Jake White would have been sacked had the Boks lost that day in Rustenburg, and the understanding was that the new broom would have swept out White\\'s captain. That Test was Smit\\'s 59th and the euphoria of the last minute win took the spotlight off what an incredibly confrontational match it was. As Smit later recalled: \"We had had enough (of losing). We were in the mood for a fight. We did not give a damn any more.\" And the Kiwis gave them a fight all alright, so much so that the discontent between the teams simmered away into the Sun City night when the teams met later. A year later Smit was a Rugby World Cup winning captain. A year after that the Lions had been defeated and a second Tri-Nations won. But a third year on Smit and the Boks are back to square one. Again, how will they respond? Is this the beginning of the end or will Smit\\'s 100th Test signal the start after another road to glory, ending in triumph at Eden Park in Auckland this time next year? If there is to be a signal of new intent, there is no better opposition for Smit\\'s Springboks to make it against than their famous rivals. A look back over Smit\\'s journey in the green and gold since his debut in 2000 shows some of his brightest episodes have featured the men in black. In the first year of his captaincy (2004) there was that incredible 40-26 defeat of the All Blacks at Ellis Park, with Marius Joubert scoring a hat-trick. A year later, the Boks defeated the New Zealanders 20-16 at Newlands in a match Smit describes as one of his all-time favourites. And in 2006, the 21-20 win at the Royal Bafokeng Palace gave Smit that aforementioned reprieve that led to such glory. Smit did not play against the Kiwis in the World Cup year of 2007 and was injured for the matches against them in 2008, but last year there were three fine wins in a row over the All Blacks - in Bloemfontein, Durban and Hamilton. Is another famous victory over Richie McCaw\\'s men imminent? The resilient Smit\\'s history with the Springboks would suggest so. Test 1, June 10, 2000: South Africa |51-18 Canada Nick Mallett gives Smit his debut. Test 7, November 12, 2000: Argentina 33 - 37 South Africa Smit starts his first Test. Harry Viljoen was the coach, the River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires the venue. Test 24, October 24, 2003: South Africa 46-19 Georgia In this Rugby World Cup match, the 25-year-old becomes the Springboks\\'s 50th captain. Test 27, June 12, 2004: South Africa 31-17 Ireland The John Smit-Jake White era begins with a handsome win in Bloemfontein. Match 29, June 16, 2004: South Africa 53-18 Wales Wales smashed at Loftus Versfeld. Match 30, July 17, 2004: Pacific Islands 24 - 38 South Africa The famous \"white-arm band\" Test in protest at contractual problems.

Test 86, August 1, 2009: South Africa 31 - 19 New Zealand Smit passes George Gregan and Will Carling\\'s joint record of 59 Tests as captain and celebrates with a win over the All Blacks. Test 88, August 29, 2009: Australia 25 - 32 South Africa The Tri-Nations all but secured with this fine win in Perth. Test 90, September 12, 2009: New Zealand 29 - 32 South Africa Smit was the Man of the Match in a memorable win in Hamilton. Test 95, June 12, 2010: South Africa 42 - 17 France.

      "IF our national flower is the protea and our national sport is soccerâ€¦ I mean rugby (hey, you guys can fight it out, I prefer boules), our national meat has to be lamb. Whether it\\'s cooked on the braai, on the spit or in a potjie, roasted in the oven, turned into sosaties, a Durban curry or a Cape Malay breyani, it\\'s the one meat that unites our dark carnivorous hearts. You can cook it slowly and thoroughly or quickly and rare. Lamb was on the menu at two launches recently. One was a new theatre restaurant, the other a regular summer spitbraai on a wine farm. Both were in rather posh if very different surroundings. The spitbraai happens every Sunday from 11.30am till sunset at AllÃ©e Bleue, at the intersection of the R45 and R310 near Franschhoek. There\\'s live music, tables with umbrellas on the lawns in front of the farm\\'s manor house, and an interior with a large table laid out with beautifully arranged plates of starters and salads and, later on, a dessert buffet. The beast is cooked in a stainless steel coffin which is the modern version of the old-fashioned spit suspended over coals out in the open for people to watch while the animal slowly turned, with regular basting. Now it happens out of sight, but I\\'ve been to such spitbraais and been fascinated to see how well it all turns out. At the stylish if sterile affair at AllÃ©e Bleue, it\\'s all sophisticated and precise. This is the well-shod, highbrow incarnation of the spitbraai, and there is clearly a market for it. I\\'d prefer something a tad more rustic where you can see the beast turning over the coals. The starter spread was lovely. Compact terrines of salmon or cheeses, crisp salads. The desserts were great - lots of fresh fruit, individual chocolate mousses, miniature pavlovas and tiramisu. There were good vegetable accompaniments, but the portions of meat - you file past chefs who serve for you - were minuscule. One chef told me they had been expecting about 40 people that day so had cooked only half a lamb. Hey, they\\'re only lambs. Two legs, two shoulders, a couple of shanks and a few ribs and they\\'re all but gone. But they tasted great and there were other meats. Having said that, give AllÃ©e Bleue\\'s spitbraais a try. The price is reasonable - R175 a head for a whole day out including a three-course meal and entertainment. On to the Theatre on the Bay in Camps Bay, where Andrea and Oscar Foulkes of Dish Food & Social have taken over the upstairs restaurant, now renamed Side Dish and serving a small menu of dishes that are good and manageable, given that everyone who dines there is going to a show not long after sitting down to dinner. It\\'s clear as you sit down that the staff know that time is key and need to get your orders on the go without wasting any time. That this happens while also serving you lovely grub, beautifully presented and with a great choice of wines (also speedily served) makes for a perfect dining experience within these precise parameters. What you don\\'t need in a theatre restaurant is lots of choice. Side Dish offers just three starters, three mains and three desserts, with one extra optional side salad. There are also specials of the day. The starters on the night were grilled prawns with parsley, garlic and chilli, tossed with linguine and lemon butter; Shanghai duck salad with watercress, mango, mint and green apple dressing, and caramelised pear and gorgonzola salad with peppery leaves, croutons and a pomegranate dressing. We ordered the last two, both of which were beautifully fresh and light. Mains were shoulder of lamb with caramelised garlic mashed potato, green beans, baby corn and a red wine jus; truffle-scented sautÃ©ed gnocchi with mushrooms, beetroot confit and fine beans with almond cream; and grilled linefish with potato croquettes, carrot and ginger purÃ©e, mangetout and gremolata dressing. The slow-cooked lamb dish was deeply flavourful and moreish. The gnocchi tasted good and were in a pleasant sauce but the gnocchi themselves did not hold their shape. Desserts were vanilla crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with pistachio biscotti, dark chocolate tart with hazelnut ice-cream and berry compote, and black cherry cheesecake with chocolate ganache. This being a launch, they served miniature versions of these in the new top-floor VIP room at the interval. The brÃ»lÃ©es were stupendously good, the chocolate tarts as chocolatey as you could hope for. The little cheesecakes were never going to compete with a brÃ»lÃ©e and anything containing lots of chocolate. A perfect way to set yourself up for the ridiculous amount of laughing you\\'ll be doing if you\\'re going to see the wildly funny Fascinating Aida. An entire lamb on the spit would scarcely be enough to fortify you for this trio\\'s relentless wit. l AllÃ©e Bleue, R45/R310 junction, between Paarl and Franschhoek 021 874 1021 l Side Dish, Theatre on the Bay, Camps Bay 021 438 3300 l Read more of Tony Jackman\\'s food writing atwww.sliver.co.za\n",

      "AS the ANC was commissioning election posters depicting PresidentJacob Zumaalongside coloured voters, it appears this week\\'s choices by the leadership have already cooked the party\\'s goose. Not only can it kiss the Western Cape goodbye, say analysts, but municipalities everywhere may now be in reach of opposition control. The most fiercely contested could be Nelson Mandela Bay, where the ANC lost major support in 2009. The ANC has announced it is going all-out for that most elusive group - \"the coloured vote\". This group has been staying away from the polls in larger numbers than any other ethnic group. It also represents the most volatile swing vote, with few historical party loyalties. There is a pervasive sentiment among coloured voters that they are only recognised at election time and that they are also losing out along the way, particularly in the job market, having not been white enough during apartheid and now not being black enough. These views were intensified by new government spin doctor Jimmy Manyi\\'s comments that they were over-represented in the Western Cape and should spread out if they wanted jobs; and more specifically by the ANC\\'s national working committee statement this week that effectively punished National Planning Minister Trevor Manuel for his attack on Manyi, for his \"racism of the worst kind\". This \"silencing\" of Manuel has underscored coloured voters\\' worst fears about the affirmative action phrase \"blacks in general, and Africans in particular\", but it also appeared to divert from the ANC\\'s core values of non-racialism, as a number of top leaders in its ranks have remarked in the past fortnight. Keith Gottschalk, UWC political scientist, insists that Manyi\\'s comments and their defence by the ANC, and in particular by Paul Ngobeni, lawyer and special adviser to Defence Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, \"amounts to an ANC gift to the DA\\'s election campaign\". \"If the ANC is serious about winning a majority in the Western Cape, it needs to persuade its members to treat African and coloured workers the same,\" Gottschalk said. \"Of course, it is true that coloured workers did not have the dompas, but they did have one-and-a-half centuries of slavery.\" In local elections much depended on mobilising voters to make their crosses. But the portion of coloured voters who had abstained from voting had been consistently higher than for other groups, said political analyst Professor Susan Booysen. It was quite possible that the Manyi debacle could result in more stayaways, but the interesting question was whether people were sufficiently angry to \"punish\" the ANC with opposition votes. In 2009 much of the Cope vote was seen as \"punishment\" by former ANC voters. A key test for Cope, the DA and the ANC would be Port Elizabeth, where the ANC\\'s traditional 80 percent majority declined dramatically to less than 50 percent in 2009. Booysen questioned whether the Cope voters would remain loyal, but if they did, there was an opportunity for DA-ID-Cope coalitions taking over an ANC stronghold, particularly if coloured anger galvanised them to make their mark. ANC insiders campaigning in coloured areas in the Eastern Cape were at their wits\\' end this week, saying it was almost a lost cause after the government\\'s defence of Manyi. \"People are up in arms. They want to know why nobody says there are too many Xhosas in the Eastern Cape,\" one said. In the Karoo and Namaqualand, Manyi\\'s comments took on a literal meaning, with people asking whether they would be any better off if they \"spread out\" across the country in search of jobs. \"Our people are applying for jobs in the defence force, the police and correctional services, but are not being considered,\" said an ANC activist. Another, Louise Boezak of Carnarvon, who has joined Cope after decades in the ANC, said: \"People are very angry with the arroganceâ€¦ I think they have now hurt our feelings and the poor are misusedâ€¦ so is unemployment.\" Though intended as being lighthearted, Manyi\\'s comments about Indians having bargained their way into management positions have also stirred anger among Durban\\'s Indian community. Rishi Singh, chairman of the Clairwood Ratepayers\\' Association, one of the oldest Indian communities in Durban, said the community was bitter. \"It\\'s apartheid in reverse,\" Singh said. Desmond D\\'Sa, a South Durban Basin community activist and chairman of the Wentworth Development Forum, said the coloured community felt betrayed by the ANC, which they overwhelmingly supported during apartheid. \"These very communities in the south basin such as Wentworth and Merebank were at the coal face of the struggle against apartheid, having produced people like Robert McBride and (Surgeon General) Veejay Ramlakan.\" HSRC senior research specialist Dr Mcebisi Ndletyana said the fallout from the Manyi saga would affect each province and region differently. He said while Manyi had been speaking in defence of government policy, the issue might have gone unnoticed had it not been for the elections coming up. \"But (it is) useful election material for the opposition,\" he said. \"It will have the biggest effect on the Western Cape, and for the ANC much will depend on Marius Fransman\\'s ability to speak out against it.\" He also believed Cosatu\\'s proposal that provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich become the ANC\\'s mayoral candidate might help mend some of the bridges burnt in the last fortnight, \"because he is a credible and visible leader among poor coloured communities\".\n",

      "Fikile Mbalula loves a good speech and his statement on the findings and recommendations of the Nicholson report into Cricket SA\\'s administrative ills opened thus: \"The Director-General of Sport and Recreation South Africa; Mr Alec Moemi; Ladies and gentlemen of the media; Fellow South Africans and sports-loving people â€¦\" A good start. \"Things being equal, today would have been an ideal day for all of us to be following Super Rugby, the build-up to the Pirates-Chiefs derby, the cricket Test between SA and New Zealand from our TV screens in the comfort of our own living rooms, or from the grandstands of our magnificent stadiums. How-ever, circumstances beyond our control have conspired and dictated that we converge here this morning to set up a remedy for the cancer diagnosed by the Ministerial Committee of enquiry into the affairs of CricketSouth Africa. These circumstances are a constant reminder that there can be no normal sport under abnormal circumstances.\" Gosh. No normal sport under abnormal circumstances, Chiefs, Pirates, Super Rugby, cancer, magnificent stadiums and the SA tour to New Zealand in one breath. Mbalula\\'s answers to the questions that followed showed that he is not in the least bit afraid of using a bad clichÃ© when he has to. \"I\\'ll cross the bridge when I get there. I don\\'t want to put the cart before the horse. I have not consulted a sangoma,\" he said, then followed that with \"either you go to heaven or you go to hell\". Fikile saved his best for last, though, when he dipped into his treasure chest of phrases from his days as the ANC Youth League president when he said that the ministry and the government would not stand for any \"insurrectionary fear mongering\" from anyone. Ah, said the journalists as they scribbled those three words down. What the hell does that mean? A few hacks chucked it into their copy to see what their subs would make of it. Expect to see those words used as a term of endearment or a joke in the near future. Kass Naidoo, CSA\\'s brand and corporate communications manager, resigned yesterday. There was some praise for her finally taking the step, some criticism that she had not done it sooner, and, from a good handful of former and present sponsors, suppliers and contractors of CSA, much celebration. It is well known that Naidoo\\'s relationship with some of the sponsors had been frosty, to say the least. The questions Injury Time were often asked by sponsors when speaking about Naidoo were: \"How has she still got a job?\", \"What exactly does she do?\" She had tried to haul at least one sponsor\\'s representatives over the coals after they had disagreed with her decision to turn down a request that they, and the media, had put to her. The boss of the representative in question told her in no uncertain terms that they were sponsors and she was the client, and that they would not be discussing the matter any further with her. Last year she invited each of the print journos to come to her office to talk about the image of CSA, and to ask them to be honest with her. She knew she was in trouble back then. Naidoo was also responsible for trying to impose accreditation conditions on the print media that were draconian and restricted them from doing their jobs. On several occasions Sanef, the national editors forum, rejected the conditions and were forced to go to CEO Majola. Had they not, newspapers and agencies would not have reported on the sport from the stadiums. Naidoo announced her resignation via her facebook page, with the headline \"Kass Naidoo tenders resignation to Cricket SA\". Then she bylined it: \"Statement by Kass Naidoo.\" That\\'s a bit like Injury Time writing about Injury Time, which we try not to do even though we love ourselves a lot more than we really should. But this isn\\'t about us, just as cricket wasn\\'t about Kass Naidoo. It really was time she left.\n",

      "Isupport the roasting of celebrities - I just wasn\\'t aware we had any celebrities to roast. How can we be tearing down people whom we refuse to put on a pedestal? The roasting tradition is not actually one of ours - it is a peculiar American ritual that has, like many others, been imported to South Africa to give local flavour to another imported television channel/series. Comedy Central (DStv) is responsible for transplanting this American custom here, and Steve Hofmeyr was the subject of the first local roast this week. It had already been the talk of the town, splashed across newspapers for days after the recording took place at Gold Reef City in Joburg. Rather absurdly, the recording was turned into a social event by a band of hard-working and persistent publicists. There could not have been much going on in Joburg that week, for it\\'s hard to believe the roasting of Hofmeyr would be deemed such an occasion. Did it really warrant the amount of news coverage it attracted? If anything, the event proved how easy it is to manipulate the media. As Hofmeyr is such a controversial figure, he was the carrot that was dangled. Hofmeyr is the ideal target for a roast. He is cheesy, parades the kind of confidence (read arrogance) that you want to see deflated, and has carved out a position for himself as what some term a \"borderline racist\" (whatever that means). This is the man who went to pay his respects to Eugene Terre\\'Blanche at his funeral, and during the hate-speech trial, threatened to sing a song including the k-word if the court permitted Julius Malema, then-ANC Youth League president, to sing Dubul\\' iBhunu (Shoot the Boer). This was after dumping his tickets to see the Irish band U2 after a favourable comment Bono was supposed to have made about the above-mentioned song - it later transpired that Bono\\'s observation had been misconstrued. Hofmeyr is like a recurring boil; you forget about him when he isn\\'t around but when he emerges, fuelling the flames of the fires, you want to see him lanced. The only problem with engineering a situation for a public kind of lancing, such as a roast, is that while the roasters work hard at undermining the credibility of their target, many are chosen because they are old chums, and they quickly slip into paying tribute. I have watched enough American roasts to know that while this ritual has been engineered to allow roasters to air that celebrity\\'s misdemeanours - flaunt them, even - at heart this event is a tribute. It is an affirmation that even though they are hugely famous, they are infallible. It also works as a kind of cleansing ritual. I am thinking here about the roast of Charlie Sheen who, like Hofmeyr, has his fair share of dirty laundry. There was a sense that the Hollywood set at his roast were there to appraise him of all his wrongs before setting him free from them. Someone might as well have told him to say three hail Mary\\'s - as per the Catholic tradition. The only problem with the roast functioning as a kind of moral cleansing ceremony is that roastees don\\'t ask for forgiveness, nor do they usually admit to any wrongdoing - though on some level, the fact that they agree to take part in this bizarre practice suggests they are seeking absolution, the kind that reinforces their celebrity position. And this is precisely what occurred during the Hofmeyr roast; he opened himself up, but only to direct attention to his celebrity status. As Hofmeyr observed at the end, he didn\\'t exactly get much of a roasting. If you had to stick to the culinary analogy you could say he was lightly sautÃ©ed in butter. This probably had something to do with the fact that SA doesn\\'t have a culture of roasting - and I mean satire. You can count the number of bona fide satirists here on one hand, and at least three of them have been sued by President Jacob Zuma. It\\'s not surprising that Hofmeyr only got a light sautÃ©eing, given that Minki van der Westhuizen was one of the roasters. Of course, the roasters themselves are carefully selected as easy targets for a bit of light roasting, too. Hence Casper de Vries and Kuli Roberts were part of the team. However, I struggled to crack a smile. The humour was lame, uninventive and certainly not sharp or deep enough to warrant the roasting appellation. Perhaps we will get better at satire as time passes and the roast evolves into something to fit our idiosyncratic context, where even the notion of a celebrity doesn\\'t carry much weight. Maybe we could call our own derivative of this American ritual a braai. I can think of a number of people who could do with a few turns over the coals - Eric Miyeni, David Bullardâ€¦ We have a long queue of people deemed by the media \"borderline racists\" just begging for a basting.\n",

      "There\\'s something seductively special and \"easy\" about going to Madikwe Game Reserve in North West. It doesn\\'t take ages to get to - especially important if you are going for two nights and don\\'t feel like having half your time out being taken up by driving, so it is an ideal short bush getaway - and I also like the fact that it\\'s malaria-free. Whatever debates or reservations you have about taking malaria tablets, when you go to Madikwe these are moot. And that\\'s a big plus in my book. We had two nights booked at Jaci\\'s Tree Top Lodge, a place that sounds romantic in the extreme and is billed as being more intimate than the nearby sister lodge Jaci\\'s Safari Lodge. Each rather large tree house - a combination of canvas and brick - is built on stilts and curves around trees. Bathrooms are open-plan - as so many are in high-end lodges these days - but there\\'s a quaintly named \"modesty curtain\" that you can use, whether you\\'re with a romantic partner or not. Everything\\'s delightfully tree-themed, from the twin basins to a \"jungle\" shower, too cold for our use at the tail end of winter, alas. I loved the heater in the toilet, nice touch that, and we were kept warm with electric blankets and heaters. Due to safety reasons, the fireplaces in the tree houses were taken away - pity, as that would have lent an additional romantic touch. I also missed not having tea-and coffee-making facilities in the room and having to walk to the main reception to get a cuppa - but that\\'s a small quibble. You wake to mornings watching the trees dance delicately against the biscuit-coloured blinds as well as the usual cacophony of jungle noises. Foregoing an early morning, we indulged in the opportuinty to relax. A breakfast/brunch is served near 11am, and you can choose to have a traditional English breakfast and an assortment of yoghurts and other continental delights, or plunge straight into a more lunchified menu of stir fry one day and lasagne and salad the next. Another nice touch, and something I haven\\'t encountered in other lodges. Staying true to the theme of leisure after a usual frantic week, we took our time and then took off along a path linking the Tree Top Lodge to the Safari Lodge. Another unusual touch - in many of these lodges you are prohibited from leaving camp, and understandably, wild beasts roam there, but it is good to get out and stretch your legs a little. The Safari Lodge comes as an unexpected surprise after the more tree-ified Tree Tops. Here, you will find a large lounge reception area decked out in bright fuchsias and other bright colours, several nooks where you can chat or bring out your laptop and be quiet and alone with your thoughts. Plus a large fire pit in the middle of the lounge with a circle of cushions around it - I could imagine a large group of friends holding marshmallows over the coals and shooting the breeze. Rooms in this lodge are more stone and brick and overlook the Marico River. There\\'s also a suite that sleeps eight to 10 people and has a braai area - appealing again, if you are in a large group. At the open air gym area, I slipped my hands into boxing gloves and released some tension. There\\'s also a spa if you like release of a different kind. It\\'s very child-friendly, with a games room for the little ones. But what really got my imagination spinning and playing was spending time in the hide overlooking the river. Romantic fantasies aside, the hide has a lovely double- bed if you want to spend the night out of doors - although the cold deterred us, a part of me flirted with the idea. But by day it\\'s a place for lodge visitors to sit and chill and watch the numbers of game that come to drink and cavort at the river. While we were there a large family of elephants with babies of various sizes came to drink, play, stamp up a few bursts of dust in jest - or not - and amble through the bush. Antelope came prancing by to drink, and we swopped reminisces of other times in the bush with other visitors, as you do when you\\'re away. There\\'s something about the hide that encourages talk, and I was moved to hear of a man\\'s journey to the lodge, with his two children, after his wife died some months ago. There\\'s also healing out there, among the sadness, and you can only wish sympathy, empathy and healing. But the bush is also about the game drive, and there\\'s something strangely soothing and also healing in heading out into nature, watching as the sun dips, and for a few moments there\\'s that magical \"sweet light\" where every photo is tinged by something goldenly magical as the light shines on a group of zebra, turning in unison, as though instructed somehow to pose for photos. While Friday night\\'s dinner had been a plated affair - beef and duck - Saturday night\\'s supper was served outside around roaring fires and consisted of potjiekos and lamb chops and vegetables. We huddled in blankets - the days were brightly hot for the end of winter, but the chill came out at night. Stars glimmered brightly as we tucked into peppermint tart to round off the meal. For me, a trip to the bush is also about being out in nature, and I love bush walks. None had been booked, but another regular guest let us know that these could be arranged and so it was, within a short time. It is special walking in the bush with large animals around, with almost a sense of danger. Of course, most animals sense and see you long before you will ever see them - and most do keep away. Walking in the bush is more about looking at the little things you would not see during a game drive - from spoor to dung trails to trees arching nakedly into the sky. It\\'s also about walking quietly through what is mostly an alien landscape for so many - hearing the twittering of birds, and the far-off cackles and barks of the animals in the distance. It\\'s a time to reflect, make memories, peel off some of the city\\'s abrasiveness. And to wonder what it might be like to spend months surrounded by sky and bush and grass, and having no agenda beyond simply being. lArja Salafranca was a guest of Jaci\\'s Tree Tops Lodge Book time away at Jaci\\'s Safari Lodge or Tree Trops Lodge, or if you\\'d like to hone your photographic skills, take part in the workshops.

      "Gary Kirsten\\'s response to a question about transformation perhaps being behind his decision not to renew his contract as the national side\\'s coach, drew a curt response. \"No. I\\'ve given my reasons and those are 100 percent what my reasons are,\" he said on Friday. The transformation of the national side remains a contentious issue. The squad for the Champions Trophy contains just two black African players, and more than two decades on from South Africa\\'s return from sport isolation, there are many people within South African cricket and outside of it who believe the sport has failed on transformation. Kirsten was drawn into the issue following the tour to Australia last year when Thami Tsolekile complained about a lack of clarity on his future in the national side. Tsolekile said Kirsten had been very clear about his stance - that he was AB de Villiers\\'s back-up in the Test side - but there were many outside of the national side who believed Kirsten could have done more to push transformation of the South African side. A meeting was held during the first Test with New Zealand in Cape Town in January where Kirsten and selection convener Andrew Hudson were asked by the then stand-in chief executive, Jacques Faul, to clear up the Tsolekile matter before Hudson was later hauled over the coals by the previous CSA Board. Meetings like the one in Cape Town didn\\'t happen often - Kirsten was largely allowed time to coach the national side - but they would have served as a reminder to him that besides the pressures of achieving results there were other issues also crucial to the agenda of South African cricket, and transformation was foremost among those. Ultimately however, the amount of time away from home proved too much for Kirsten, who throughout his tenure as coach spelled out the importance of returning home and being a dad to his three children - all aged under 10. Ironically, it was the last few weeks at home which ultimately made up his mind for him. \"I feel I can no longer cope with the lengthy periods of separation from my family that this job demands,\" he said on Friday. \"I believe that my responsibilities as a father and to my family are being compromised. \"I\\'ve just had five weeks at home now, which is the longest period I\\'ve had at home for a number of years, and I began to realise what my absence as a father (was doing) and what effect it has had on my family.\" Under Kirsten\\'s guidance, a South African side which had touched success only briefly in 2008/09, finally began to realise just how good they were and established themselves as the best Test team in the world. South Africa won six out of seven Test series\\' in the two years Kirsten was in charge, drawing only his first series as coach with Australia in 2011. In 19 Tests in that time, they lost just twice and the highlights of his tenure would have to be the tours to England and Australia. South Africa sit securely atop the Test rankings, though their position will be challenged next season when India and Australia tour here. The limited overs formats were a lot less successful. There certainly didn\\'t appear to be much of a plan with the T20 side. They lost all their Super Six games at the World T20 Championships in Sri Lanka last year - and last season saw Kirsten hand over responsibility for that unit to his now replacement Russell Domingo. The one-day team also lacks the consistency of its Test cousin - SA won only 13 of 24 ODIs during Kirsten\\'s coaching tenure - and a feeling persists that no proper plan exists for the World Cup, which is now less than two years away. The strategising for that event now falls firmly in Domingo\\'s lap. Kirsten\\'s two-year stint as coach will be remembered for the heights that South Africa reached, but more importantly it was the emphasis he placed on the players to grow as people, to look beyond the professional sports bubble and become better human beings. \"One of my primary objectives was to facilitate in growing people. That is a wonderful privilege in coaching and leadership. \"I\\'m not in coaching for performance. I\\'m measured on my performance, but I\\'m in leadership and coaching because I want to help people be the best they can be,\" Kirsten explained. \"The players are the ones going out and making the performances and while as a coach I\\'m measured by whether the team do well or not, to me that\\'s almost not as relevant as the influence I can have on individuals in that team. \"I\\'d like to think that in the two years I was with the team I had some impact with some of the players and that\\'s been very important to me.\"\n",

      "Many will agree that if there is one person who polarises opinion within the legal fraternity, it would be Western Cape Judge President John Hlophe. For some, Hlophe\\'s appearance before the Judicial Service Commission committee to consider his alleged attempt to influence two Constitutional Court judges to rule in favour of Jacob Zuma when he faced corruption charges is a culmination of the many controversies he has been involved in. His opponents point to the 2004 case between the late former health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and the pharmaceutical industry when he was accused of having delayed his judgment until the industry took the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal. They will point to allegations that he is said to have referred a sensitive case on Afrikaans language rights to a judge who would \"mess up the case so that it could be taken on appeal\". Then there were issues of Hlophe\\'s son receiving a bursary from a law firm which seemed to have some form of relationship with his dad and the controversial case brought up by US-based Professor Winston Nagan, who claimed Hlophe had defamed him. Attempts have indeed been made to have Hlophe\\'s career brought to a halt. We may remember he was one of the youngest people to be appointed to the Bench post-1994, and was the first full-time academic to be appointed a judge. Coming with a Cambridge doctorate, he was a rising star. So, where did he lose the plot, or did he? And, what does the current enquiry teach us? Most of his critics will point out that Hlophe should have been hauled over the coals for his seemingly errant behaviour, but there might also be those who may argue he should have known better and covered his back. It is almost unavoidable for some of us to suspect that Hlophe has to face these allegations primarily for the 2004 report he wrote to the late Chief Justice Pius Langa in which he claimed racism at the Cape Bar. It will be recalled how prominent members of the Cape Bar Council went into overdrive to try to discredit Hlophe\\'s assertions. The seeming unified force to \"disabuse\" the public of Hlophe\\'s assertions was nonetheless dealt a blow when Dumisa Ntsebeza SC, respected for his long principled struggle for his liberation and impeccable credentials as a jurist, broke ranks and resigned from the Cape Bar, thus giving some credence to the fact that Hlophe\\'s views were not necessarily off the mark. Since 2004, some have judged Hlophe not on his credentials as a brilliant judge, focus has instead been on some of his misjudgments. It has since been as if talking about racism and pointing out alleged racial and racist practices within the legal fraternity is prohibited. We will recall how the same attack and subsequent \"rubbishing\" was mounted against Sipho Seepe after he had made a submission to the Human Rights Commission that there was a need to investigate possible racialised practices and attitudes in the media. Instead of holding a mirror to themselves at the time and asking the self-critical question whether allegations of racial prejudice could be correct, many newsrooms went into a discursive mode which some scholars at the time summarised as \"splitting, dislocating, relativising, trivialising, de-racialising and ultimately reverse racism\". The results were a watered-down report and public debate that failed to address serious problems in newsrooms. Similarly, the manner in which some in the legal fraternity dealt with Hlophe\\'s assertions at the time suggested there was an attempt to dislocate him and trivialise his claims. Thus, in the place of addressing real issues that arise from a history of accumulated white privilege and continued marginalisation of black people (black lawyers in this case) those who express grievances against the system of patronage in the legal fraternity are ridiculed and forced to become defensive. The strategy would not just be to dislocate and trivialise, but to also displace the problem, so that focus can shift from the original grievances (in this case allegations of racism) to something else. Ultimately, the original issues are forgotten, while secondary matters receive sustained attention. Any black person who pursues uncomfortable questions will be subjected to relentless scrutiny of their personal lives, where \"dirt\" will be dug up to silence them, as happened to Paul Ngobeni. And such a person must be punished. That is how ruthless white privilege can be. It is against this background that we must ask whether Hlophe is being brought before the JSC tribunal to serve the interests of a respectable |judiciary or to silence a critical voice. n Tleane is a PhD (Sociology) candidate at UCT.\n",

      "DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko has slammed the official opposition\\'s national communications head, Gavin Davis, in a rant on Facebook. This was after the party was exposed for attempting to intimidate the SA Institute of Race Relations into ending its #SAIRRknowyourANC campaign, which aimed to highlight achievements by the ANC government since 1994. Davis is understood to have asked Mazibuko for help in communicating the party\\'s opposition to the institute\\'s campaign. But Mazibuko did not take kindly to the request. \"People who bully, bait, and are aggressive and offensive in the name of the organisationI represent, must not send me e-mails asking me to go on Twitter and defend their actions,\" she wrote on her Facebook page. \"You are an Emotional Intelligence vacuum. Clean up your own mess. Yes, this is a subtweet. #PoliticalSA\" Mazibuko refused to comment on the post this week, while Davis said it was \"no big deal\". \"People in the DA are free to disagree with each other if they like. Of course it is preferable for people to raise these issues openly and directly in the appropriate forums,\" he said. Davis has taken flack from members of the DA over the incident, and was described by party insiders as divisive. \"He\\'s a f***n prick. He\\'s been incredibly divisive,\" said one leader. Davis, who apparently has the support of DA leader Helen Zille, is also said to have been the reason for the departure from the party of several staff members. \"There\\'s no love between Gavin and almost anyone. He\\'s the most hated executive director, but he\\'s very protected by Helen Zille and everyone knows it,\" the same senior DA leader said. \"Gavin\\'s Helen (Zille\\'s) man.\" But Mazibuko is not the only DA leader to take to Facebook to discuss internal party issues. The Sunday Independent has established that the DA is also investigating one of its leaders in Gauteng for comments he made on Facebook. DA deputy chief whip in the Joburg council and the province\\'s deputy head of its electoral college, Toni Molefe, has been hauled over the coals for comments he made recently on the social networking platform. Molefe is accused of victimising candidates who wanted to go to Parliament and the Gauteng legislature. This was after he wrote to his political ally, DA MP Masizole Mnqasela, that the latter should \"please give me a list of those who did not vote for you at the federal congress, we must not forget their names on Saturday\". Mnqasela contested, and lost to the party\\'s current federal chairman Wilmot James, for the post at the DA\\'s congress last year. Mnqasela is known for his fierce opposition to Mazibuko and Zille. Molefe, a staunch supporter of DA spokesman Mmusi Maimane, posted the comments about two days before the province was to hold a meeting to vote on those it wants to take to the Gauteng legislature and Parliament. Gauteng DA chairman Mike Moriarty confirmed that Molefe was being investigated for this. He said Molefe was asked to recuse himself from the voting process of the electoral college late last month after it came to light that he had made the comments. \"There were candidates who felt that there was an active lobby against them. It is a matter of investigation,\" he said. Moriarty said Molefe had not denied making the comments and that he would be asked to tell his side of the story. \"All of this is done on the presumption of innocence,\" he said. The investigation into Molefe\\'s comments would determine whether or not the party needed to take disciplinary action. Molefe refused to comment. In the report \"DA\\'s Mazibuko lashes colleagues in Facebook rant\", on October 20, 2013, we quoted an anonymous DA leader\\'s negative attitude towards the party\\'s national communications director, Gavin Davis. The comments created an unfair impression that this view was shared by several people in the party and could have been construed as fact. We also failed to give Mr Davis the opportunity to respond to the allegation, as required by the Press Code. We regret the error. Sorry.\n",

      "DURING the State |of the Nation debate in Parliament last month, PresidentJacob Zumawas |taken to task by opposition parties over the overarching theme of his address; radical socio-economic transformation. While the president claimed this would be the ANC and the government\\'s motivation is its programme of action for his second term, both the DA and the Economic Freedom Fighters, the two main opposition parties in Parliament, challenged this notion. They both contended that there was nothing radical about the president\\'s plans to transform the economy, land ownership patterns or job creation. To the EFF, radical means the expropriation of land without compensation and the nationalisation of key economic assets like banks and mines. This is unlikely to happen while Zuma is in office. However, as the furore over Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti\\'s policy proposals on land redistribution gained momentum in the last few weeks, one could be forgiven for thinking the minister has been |having too much coffee with |Julius Malema in the corridors on Parliament. Nkwinti has proposed a policy according to which white farmers would be forced to give up 50 percent of their land for redistribution to farmworkers. The money paid by government for the land would not go to the farmers, but would be allocated in a |fund to support the emerging black farmers with skills, training and farming equipment. Nkwinti was quick to point out this week that this was in fact |contained in the ANC\\'s own policy documents from the 2012 policy |conference. The proposal has been slammed by the Freedom Front Plus as |equal to expropriation without compensation, but it remains a policy proposal. However, government this week moved on the land issue when Zuma signed into law the land restitution and property valuation bill, which effectively reopens the process for people dispossessed of land to |submit claims. This is an ANC policy adopted at the Mangaung conference in 2012, where the phrase \"radical socio-economic transformation\" dominated ANC discussions. The phrase has been sustained and it shaped the tone of the party\\'s manifesto and Zuma\\'s State of the Nation Address. It appears that the party is succumbing to the realisation that |business can no longer continue as usual, but many would be disheartened by the previous promises of radical shifts from macro-economic policies that have failed to transform the lives of millions of the poor. The announcement by the president that government would investigate the issue of a national minimum wage should be understood in the context of growing discontent over income inequalities. It is a contentious issue between the ANC and its alliance partners on the Left, and even the president\\'s promise to \"investigate\" it was met with suspicion, especially over the lack of time frames being announced for the process The recent five-month Amcu strike in the mining sector, which had a negative effect on the economy and might still result in the loss of jobs in the sector, has shown how urgent the equal distribution of the country\\'s resources is. The realignment of power among the labour unions - Cosatu-affiliated National Union of Mineworkers is being ravaged by the growth of Amcu and Numsa planning a break-away from Cosatu - are indications that labour might become the new frontier over which the battle for socio-economic transformation is fought during this term. But if there is one thing that unions agree on, it is the introduction of the national minimum wage. Introducing it would go a long way in addressing the income inequalities in the labour market, but its most vocal critics believe it will be detrimental to job creation. Government\\'s target of 5 percent growth by 2019 is an ambitious |target that, if realised, would in all likelihood see the creation of more jobs, but this will not be easy. Figures released by Statistics SA last month showed the country\\'s gross domestic product (GDP) |had contracted 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year. This was its first contraction since the second quarter of 2009, when the global economy was sliding into a recession. Zuma was to start his first term in the same year, and he has now started his second time when unemployment remains incredibly high, especially among the youth. Government appears to be relying on massive infrastructure development project for the creation |of more than 6 million jobs by 2019, but unions are convinced that these are not \"real jobs\". The main election issue in the run-up to the recently held elections was the economy, and the ANC appears to realise that massive job creation is not possible in an economy that is not growing, or that growing too little too slowly. The establishment of the Small Business Development ministry, |and the appointment of Lindiwe Zulu as the minister for this portfolio, has signalled the need for an emphasis on the development of small businesses as a means to |create jobs. It shows government can no longer rely on big business to create jobs, and that the informal sector has never been this important to the growth of the overall economy. The deployment of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan to the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs was a big appointment that probably signals emphasis on service delivery. Gordhan is heading a department which is at the coalface of service delivery, and the number of service delivery protests that have taken place this year alone indicates how fed up people are with the lack of delivery by most municipalities. This week, the president announced the appointment of various inter-ministerial committees, including that of service delivery which Gordhan will chair. According to the presidency, |its purpose is to fast-track service delivery in areas where there are bottlenecks, quickly respond to areas where there are service delivery problems and ensure that general service delivery is improved. This will be particularly important for the government and the ruling party as the local government elections are set to take place in 2016. The forced removals of residents in Lwandle saw government responding with speed, with |ministers dispatched to the area as soon as news of the evictions made the headlines. While ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe maintains this will be a standard response to such issue by the executive, it remains to be seen whether it will be maintained throughout the term. But more importantly, the response that communities are crying out for is the actual delivery of the services they are protesting over. This week the country was faced with rolling power outages in |various regions, highlighting the massive power constraints the country still has to deal with. The National Planning Commission and the Department of Energy are known to have argued for the delay in the procurement of nuclear energy, but government is intent on forging ahead in the face of massive energy constraints to the economy. This perhaps signals a radical shift from an administration that has previously appeared content with leaving Eskom and the SA Nuclear Energy Corporation to come up with ways of increasing the country\\'s energy security. It is perhaps against this background that there seems to be more focus on a \"sustainable energy mix\" that includes coal, solar, wind, hydro, gas and nuclear energy. Some of the measures that government is introducing are described by critics as long over due, and far from being radical. However, it can be argued that the sounds coming from government indicate a somewhat belated realisation that business can no longer be done as usual. mogomotsi.magome@inl.co.za\n",

      "One could write an entire thesis on the ANC government\\'s faults regarding revenue expenditure - whether it be tender corruption, government\\'s wasteful spending, the bloated cabinet, the public sector wage bill, the nuclear deal with Russia or Nkandla - the ANC\\'s track record does not inspire confidence. However, I would like to focus on the former concern - that is - how revenue is divided. After making provision for debt-service costs, the total revenue available for the 2015 national Budget amounts to approximately R1.1 trillion. Of this, the national share of non-interest expenditure is about 48 percent, provinces receive 43 percent and 9 percent goes to municipalities. Persistent slow economic growth has resulted in the economy failing to raise the revenue needed to balance the Budget. Therefore, in order to balance the Budget, the deficit has to be funded by increasing debt which is currently R1.584 billion. The net debt has grown from 21.8 percent in 2009, when Jacob Zuma became president, to 40.8 percent in 2014/15. Debt-servicing costs for the 2014/15 financial year are estimated to be R115bn. This is more than a worrying trend, and the result is there is less money for government to spend effectively. What follows is that revenue allocations to the three spheres of government, particularly for provinces and local government, will grow at a slower rate than previous years. Moreover, there will be reductions of R11bn in the allocations for provinces and an almost R2bn reduction in allocations to local government over the next two fiscal years. The impact this will have on service delivery cannot be overstated. Municipalities and local government are at the coal face of service delivery and economic growth, as city-led infrastructure growth paves the way for job creation, yet only 9 percent of the national revenue is allocated to local government. Zuma proudly boasts about government\\'s \"back to basics\" local government revitalisation programme. However, with insufficient funds and maladministration at local government level, it seems the government is turning its back on basics - basic service delivery and basic infrastructure growth. Without sufficient funds, local government cannot function optimally, which has far-reaching negative effects on service delivery and infrastructure growth. Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene stated that local government received a smaller share of the division of revenue because municipalities had significant revenue raising powers, which include property rates and service charges. Thus, according to Nene, for local government to function effectively, the bulk of its revenue will not come from national government, but from the pockets of the people. While there are substantive objections to this approach that are beyond the scope of this discussion, it is the procedural hurdles that are relevant here. According to the Treasury, aggregate consumer debt that is owed to municipalities amounted to a massive R96.6bn as of December 31, most of which is realistically not collectable. This amount has more than doubled since 2010, when the figure was R43bn. In other words, even if this was substantively fair and agreed to, in practice it simply isn\\'t working. Municipalities are failing to collect this revenue, meaning Nene\\'s reasoning does not hold. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Pravin Gordhan made a commitment to cut this debt owed to municipalities, yet we see no progress on this matter. This is yet another example of an ANC cabinet that is at odds with itself. We see one minister pointing to local governments own seemingly functional revenue raising ability, yet another minister pointing out the glaring failures in that revenue- raising ability, suggesting changes to the way municipalities collect money.

      "At the the beginning of every South African academic year the same concerns are raised by teachers and parents; too many learners, too few teachers, overcrowded classrooms, too few resources and lack of infrastructure. The situation, according to most educators, is getting worse. What has to change? Basically everything, believe those who are trying to revolutionise the way that learners and those entering the tertiary sector are taught. In short, say this new breed of learning innovators, you not only have to think out of the box, you have to invent a new box - a digital one that may incorporate artificial intelligence or one that finds a way to dramatically improve the quality of teaching. When you have a class of only 10 matrics and they all fail, you know something has gone wrong. When you have substantially more boys than girls sitting for their final exams, you know the system is not working. Many of those advocating radical changes are teachers already at the coal face dealing with what they say are \"insurmountable\" odds. Among them is long-serving Western Cape teacher and advocate of change, Maryke Bailey who in a recent interview said that overcrowding in the classrooms remains a number one issue with teachers struggling to deliver effective lessons to over 50-60 children. \"We are failing our children in terms of resources and class sizes, but the problem is bigger than that. There is a teaching crisis in South Africa. We are not producing teacher excellence across the board, and lack of resources and the overcrowding just add to the problem. \"We have to come up with creative ways in which teachers can teach effectively even in adverse conditions.\" Stellenbosch-based professor Patrick Bean, executive dean of STADIO Faculty of Education and Humanities\\' School of Education (formerly Embury) believes that one way to improve the quality of education is to embrace the rapid development of technology and connectivity around the world and use distance learning as an educational tool. \"The main goal of introducing technology into education must be to level the playing fields - making education accessible to everybody, beyond the geographical and/or wealth barriers.\" The idea is not falling on deaf ears. President Cyril Ramaphosa\\'s ambitious target to ensure that every school child in the country has access to a tablet with digital workbooks and textbooks within the next six years could be the starting point together with his introduction of compulsory early childhood education. \"We will start with those schools that have been historically most disadvantaged and are located in the poorest communities,\" he said. Some may see the tablet idea as putting the cart before the horse. Others, like Bean, see it as the beginning of a home-grown digital learning revolution. Let\\'s look at who\\'s doing what in this brave new world of learning. On a global scale, one of those leading the way to a digital transition in schools and tertiary institutions is the Learning Counsel, a mission-based online organisation that recently developed one of the first thesis of education\\'s future, based on technology\\'s evolution. \"Our aim,\" said one of thecounsel\\'s new-age educators \"is to help schools advance systematically with the digital transition, which in our view is no longer an option, but a fast-accelerating reality.\" Educational gaming might sound like an oxymoron, but it\\'s a button that is being pushed more and more by those seeking solutions to overcrowding and lack of resources like we have in South Africa. Said Suzi Wilczynski, an independent developer of interactive educational games for kids, \"Learning games are built the same way a teacher builds a lesson. \"I believe that games can change the way kids learn.\" She admits it\\'s no small venture. \"A single game requires the work of skilled writers, game designers, educators, artists, game architects, and database developers. It may sound daunting, but whether we like it or not, it is the way that future learning is going.\" In one of her latest interactive \"edu\" games, Grade 8 pupils are invited to travel through space to distant planets with a make-believe scientist who explains the chemical components of each planet and whether life would be possible. A former archaeologist and middle school teacher, she said she founded her Dig-It! Games learning platform, because there was, in her view, a \"crying need\" for a seamless blend of fun and learning for children. \"We start with a learning goal and then we work backwards.\" One of the key issues, she said, was that textbooks, especially in poorer communities, were not affordable and often not available. An added problem was that in a rapidly changing world textbooks that took a year or so to publish, could be out of date by the time they reached the classroom. \"Today children are themselves activists for change,\" said Jamie Beaton chief executive of Crimson Education, a start up dedicated to connecting learners from over the world to resources, mentors and career pathways that are right for them. Currently, the company has a network of more than 2000 expert tutors, consultants and mentors across the globe. \"Education must be restructured to ensure it prepares pupils for the digital world they will be working in. This means combining elements of traditional teaching with new digital frameworks for learning skills. \"The idea of \\'gamifying\\' the learning environment is crucial in tapping into the young Gen Z brains.\" The idea behind Game-based learning, said Beaton, was that it enabled students to actively engage with the material they were studying and the brain processes challenges and mistakes that transpired. \"We don\\'t need more time in the classroom to learn how to think and perform in the face of real-world challenges. We need effective, interactive experiences that motivate and actively engage us in the learning process.\" At this point you might ask: what\\'s the point of teachers? The answer to that, said educators like Bean, was to look at blended learning models that included personal interaction with teachers and lecturers, as well as a strong distance education component. \"Today E-learning forms part of most distance learning (and contact learning) options and offers a richer experience encompassing every imaginable format of web-based learning, from digital textbooks to video lectures and virtual reality experiences.\" There are, however, challenges to the uptake of e-learning in South Africa. One is connectivity and high costs of data. The king of innovators, Elon Musk said connectivity for the masses was in his sights, sooner than later. Could this mean that AI \"coaches\" or \"teachers\" would soon be able to prompt pupils to finish coursework, suggest new content and answerquestions? It\\'s a brave new world. The question is: will South Africa be ready for it. Should we ask Siri, or wait forthe next click and drag in the Echapter?\n",

      "With pic A tribute to the late Monde Tabata By David Moshapalo In 1995, the minister of Trade and Industry (DTI), Alec Erwin invited the two major black business formations - Fabcos, representing mainly informal businesses, and Nafcoc, a black chamber of commerce, to facilitate and drive the establishment of an umbrella body to act as his sounding board. This body had to have representation in all the nine new provinces of SA. The instruction was also to include other businesses outside the two established black business membership bases. Its very representative board, supported by a small secretariat, had to reflect the demographics of ABC (Africans, Coloureds and Indians) in line with the new SA Constitution. With a small head office Secretariat and a National footprint. This national body was called the National Small Business Council (NSBC) and I was elected its first president. At the time I was the Secretary-General of Fabcos, and I proposed to the NSBC that we invite Monde Tabata to head our secretariat on a volunteer basis until the funding and contractual agreement for the NSBC had been finalized with DTI. He was a member of the National Black Business Caucus (NBBC) which had participated in an interaction with the ANC at Phinda Game Reserve in Natal and Mopani in the Kruger National Park in anticipation of the new ANC-led government and a bright future for the black South Africans post the demise of apartheid. Tabata attended with yours truly the Mopani deliberations - a brainchild of Willie Ramoshaba, a black business activist and a distinguished publisher of Enterprise Magazine. Tabata was always in the forefront of what was happening at that historic event. He and an equally energetic Xolani Qubeka were elected scribes of various discussion breakaway groups. We later went on a number of study tours overseas to find a model that we could localize and settled on America\\'s Small Business Administration (SBA). This formation had a lobby element and other services it offered to its broad membership. It was respected for its successful support programmes that assisted the minorities especially women-owned firms and those owned by African Americans and Latinos. Our objective was to empower the majority of black South Africans who were excluded from the main stream economy. When funding for the NSBC was concluded with the DTI months later, the selection of Tabata as CEO was made permanent. This was a unanimous decision. Our NSBC executive members were drafted into the various DTI task teams. Our delegation was ably led by the charismatic and energetic Tabata. The outcome of this extensive work was a proposal to establish two government agencies: namely, Ntsika to offer small businesses non-financial support, and Khula to offer them financial support. In 1995, a huge historical SMME conference was held in Durban, and Tabata pulled it off with a small NSBC team. After vigorous debates and inputs by the delegates it was agreed that the two agencies would complement the services that were provided and sold by the black business federations and chambers to their members. Historically, the black business bodies were struggling financially because they were providing services to many struggling black small and micro enterprises. Some could not pay their stipulated membership dues. Being at the coal face, Tabata was frustrated by how things turned out later after the SMMEs Conference. Ntsika was perceived by the black organizations to be unfair competition to them by offering free training and other services to their existing members and potential members. These issues were raised sharply with Tabata and this was always an agenda item on our work programme. Khula\\'s credit guarantee scheme for SMMEs was largely ignored or poorly supported by the established four big banks. Tabata championed a shared services model for the agencies and the black businesses movements as proposed by the NSBC board. Unfortunately his proposals were not accepted by DTI. The agencies have since been rebranded and their activities and offerings have been refocused. Sadly, the NSBC is no more. Today 25 years later it is sad to see that the black businesses in the \"klein dorpies\" are still struggling financially though some are represented on the boards of these DTI agencies. Regrettably, our vision for a stronger and vibrant SMME Government support has not been realized. We are hopeful that in his memory and others who have passed on the Black Economic Struggle Stage the ministry of small business will scale up support for this key part of the South African economy. I salute Tabata, and take comfort in his numerous achievements before and after the fanfare of the short-lived era of the NSBC. His successful career in the corporate world, charity and his passion in the promotion of rugby in the Eastern Cape defined his stature as a giant. Lala ngoxolo Mawawa, Mpinga!

      "This time it is the Gautrain. Last time – March 2021 – it was eNCA reporter Lindsay Dentlinger, who claimed to not be racist after we had witnessed her act in a patently racist manner when she insisted that black politicians don their masks while she was fine with white politicians speaking to her without their masks donned. But, I digress. Back to our racist pics in our beloved elite train, the Gautrain. The type of apparently inadvertent racism, bluntly displayed on the Gautrain, which has made life easier for the middle class, much as it has created thousands of jobs, to its credit. The operators, management, marketing and advertising teams of the high-speed train should be called out on the undesirable racism expressed – whether inadvertently, by design or omission – in their vaccination adverts, now replaced by other ads – that exhibited a disconcerting pictorial message: that blacks must always be masked because they probably carry a more potent form of pathogens of the coronavirus, whereas whites need not really be masked because they presumably don’t carry any pathogens of the coronavirus. The three adverts that were meant to encourage South Africans to vaccinate show two photographs of an African and Asian man masked, whereas the photograph of a white woman is shown unmasked: by any definition in any society that seeks to stamp out subliminal racism in advertising, this is racism. It must be bluntly called what it is, simply, white racism. Executives, senior managers whose entities operate and manage the Gautrain and their service providers who were involved in the creation, curation and approval of these adverts, should be castigated harshly. The Gauteng government, specifically Premier David Makhura, should summon the Gautrain operators to explain how and why they approved the curation and display of such despicably racist adverts on the Gautrain. If the premier is not prepared to erase all types of racial discrimination from our experience, including on the Gautrain, then perhaps our prayerful behest should be for him to give way to someone far more courageous in their crack of the whip. Facing off against racism is no staple for wimps, it is the calling of courageous hearts. At any rate, our Constitution behoves the premier of Gauteng to act decisively, rake over the coals the operators and marketing communications folks who approved these definitively racist adverts on the Gautrain. Perhaps, it can be opined, that more than half a century of state-sponsored racism could not possibly be overcome in a time span of about three decades since former president Nelson Mandela was released from prison. In other words, no change of heart can be legislated into the reality of experience. Yet, the difficulty of the task should not daunt us from such an honourable endeavour to rid our country of all forms of racial discrimination, blatant or subtle. Racism is a horrible scourge that undermines the dignity of the citizenry of our country and clearly such ads should have been curated by people with some common sense, to depict the ideal of equality and respect for human dignity expressed in our Constitution. Although we no longer have to don our masks outdoors, we still have to slap them on when travelling on the Gautrain. Perhaps, gleaning from the abominable racist ads, for the Gautrain bigwigs only black people should wear masks, while white people need not really, unless they feel the need. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Maybe, devil if I would ever know, things will change as they change, for a change. Yet, for now, the entire thing is a rosette of putrid shame. A blight. We are the worst for it. Heaven help us.\n",

      "In this special report we look at Roadlink boss Allan Reddy and his headline-grabbing bus service Burnt-out staff get peanuts \\'They are always on the road to augment their salaries by working overtime\\' NASHIRA DAVIDS and SASHNI PATHER SOME SA Roadlink drivers are paid a meagre R3000 a month - forcing them to stay behind the wheel for longer, just to earn a few extra bucks. \"You can imagine the fatigue - they don\\'t have time to rest. They are always on the road to augment their salaries by working overtime,\" said Assaria Mataboge, national sector co-ordinator for the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union. Mataboge said SA Roadlink drivers earned between R3000 to R4000 a month. Bus drivers for other companies, however, were paid an average of R7000 or more. \"They don\\'t even have medical aid. The company does not subsidise them, so even if they do decide to join - with that little salary - they will not be able to afford it.\" Mataboge also said that the employees had to drive 400km and more alone and that this could contribute to fatigue and the risk of accidents. He said staff might be too intimidated to join the union. SA Roadlink CEO Allan Reddy said that pension and medical aid were voluntary but he did not confirm nor deny the amount that drivers were paid. Instead, he said it was disgruntled employees fired for fraud and theft who had made these claims. Reddy conceded that his staff were not affiliated to a union. \"If the majority of these employees do not want to join, I cannot force them.\" This week Reddy had a nasty serving of negative publicity dumped on his plate. In addition to being hauled over the coals by Western Cape transport MEC Robin Carlisle for the state of his vehicles, one of his drivers was arrested for drunk driving last Saturday, and released on bail. On Monday, the company announced that it had provisionally suspended the driver, pending an \"internal investigation\". But this is not the first time an SA Roadlink driver has been in the spotlight for drunk driving. In 2005 Charles William Vaudin was arrested for being seven times over the legal limit, but he got his job back the next year. Shortly afterwards he was involved in a smash where 12 people were killed. He was acquitted of all charges. On Tuesday, Reddy and a delegation from his company met with Western Cape MEC for community safety Lennit Max. He said law enforcement officers in the province were colluding with the media to tarnish the company\\'s image. Reddy claimed to have information that traffic officials were giving the media tip-offs before hauling his buses off the road. \"Reddy said officers made arrangements to have Roadlink on national television - as if Roadlink was the only culprits in the business,\" said Max. Reddy also claimed that a passenger overheard an officer vow to \"put (Reddy) out of business\" and that the officer had received orders from the MEC. \"I put it to him that many of the buses which were pulled off unfortunately had faults,\" said Max. Reddy responded: \"You have to factor in road conditions as well. That could set something off in the bus. That happens to all buses on our roads.\" •See Mampara on Page 6 of Review YULETIDE MASSACRE: Twelve people were killed in a 2006 Christmas Eve accident involving an SA Roadlink bus in Pietermaritzburg Picture: JACKIE CLAUSEN CONTROVERSIAL: SA Roadlink CEO Alan Reddy, accused by traffic authorities in two provinces of running an unsafe fleet of buses, claims that he is being unfairly targeted Picture: JAMES OATWAY\n",

      "FOOD FESTIVALS Our land of lekker Highlighting local produce is a great way to encourage tourism, as many South African towns have discovered. shares a round up of up-coming food festivals The South African Cheese Festival, Franschhoek What started out as a small event organised by an independent cheese maker was taken over by Agri Expo in 2002, and grown into one of the country\\'s biggest. It\\'s so popular today that this has become one of its major drawbacks - and to control the crowds the organisers have stopped selling entry at the gate. Tickets are now only available through Computicket, and it is best to purchase well before the event. For cheese lovers, it is heaven. All the large commercial cheese producers are there, so expect to find large heads of popular local SA cheeses (lots of cheddars and goudas) carved into minute blocks for the hordes to enjoy. The charm of the festival is in the small artisanal cheese-makers, who showcase their wares. The number has grown considerably over the years and the range is impressive. The festival has expanded to include a range of complementary foods like breads, olives, jams, preserves, relishes, chocolates and, of course, wine. The best way to enjoy the festival is to visit on a weekday, preferably, and pick up a range of foodstuffs to make your own picnic to enjoy under the trees, where chairs and tables are laid out - and entertainment is provided. An interactive demonstration kitchen featuring a number of the country\\'s top chefs and food personalities is another popular feature of the festival. April 24 - 27 Bien Donné, Franschhoek10am - 6pm daily, but it closes at 5pm on the last day.Tickets: R110 for Saturday and Sunday, R90 for Monday and Tuesday.Senior citizens: R70.Children under 12 get in free.For more information, visit www.cheesefestival.co.za Lamberts Bay Crayfish & Cultural Festival A couple of hours from Cape Town up the West Coast is the coastal town of Lamberts Bay. Famous for its long stretches of white beaches and Bird Island (home to Cape Gannet), it is well known as the crayfish Mecca of the country. This year marks their ninth crayfish festival, which takes place soon after the crayfish season closes. Of course, crayfish are in abundance at the festival and the organisers have got it down to a fine art. At their venue on the outskirts of the town, the crayfish are cooked in large black pots and then roasted over the coals. Prepared in West-coast style, the crayfish cost R70 and are served with two sauces, boiled potatoes and green salad. Fresh oysters will also be on sale at R10 per oyster. If crayfish is not your thing, the local Muisbosskerm restaurant will be serving paella, and there will be other food stalls. The festival has been extended to include over 100 stalls and a big attraction is the music festival, which this year includes Steve Hofmeyer in the line-up. As is the festival custom, on Sunday morning they hold an interdenominational thanksgiving service. April 22-25 Ticket price includes entrance to the music festival.Thursday: 6pm onwards, R40 for adults and R20 for children (3 -11 years).Friday: From 9am, R100 for adults, R50 for children. Saturday: From 8am, R140 for adults and R50 for children. Sunday: 9am church service.

Unlike most other festivals, the event does not take place under one roof but involves 23 pit-stops on the specially designed festival route map. It is the perfect chance to soak up the ambience of this beautiful region and sample the new-season olive oils, including the famous Kloovenburg range. There will be lots of interesting products to taste and buy, including olive jams and relishes; and table olives cured in a number of different ways, like green manzanilla olives in a lime dressing, shiraz-infused olives and even an olive chocolate salami. April 30 - May 2For more information, visit www.riebeekvalley.info The Prince Albert Festival In the hamlet of Prince Albert, the townsfolk annually celebrate all this fertile valley has to offer. It is a community event and you can feel the spirit of unity as everyone comes together to share their best produce. Take a stroll down the main street and check out what the locals are selling at their stalls set up specially for the two days. The organisers always have a number of fun events, which draw the crowds. A highlight is the olive-spitting competition. The local street band adds to the carnival spirit, as does the vintage-car parade and, last year, the circus school came to town. Prince Albert offers plenty of accommodation for visitors and there are many restaurants and coffee shops. Don\\'t forget to visit the local olive farms and watch the new-season olive-oil pressing. Wine tasting can be done at the smallest wine farm in the centre of the town, Soet Karoo, or head off to Bergwater Wine Estate for their quality reds and whites. Africa\\'s largest fig farm, Weltevrede, opens its doors to the public during the festival and the small town boasts its own cookery school, African Relish, which is drawing both local and international visitors to the Karoo town.

      "Death threat as ANC, labour clash Cosatu warned its general secretary will die after comments on graft in high places ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION NKULULEKO NCANA and BRUCE GORTON THE general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), Zwelinzima Vavi, has received a letter containing a death threat, the union reports. The federation said the letter reads: \"You will die like Molefi.\" The union said this was presumed to be a reference to Molefi Sefularo, the South African deputy minister of health who died in a car accident outside Pretoria on April 5 this year. \"This could imply that the writer knows that it was not an accident,\" Cosatu said. It said the letter had been referred to the head of the SA Police Service, General Bheki Cele, for investigation. \"But we also know that the best protection against such threats is the support of the masses,\" said the union. It said it had no reason to associate the letter with the ANC national working committee\\'s decision to take disciplinary action against its general secretary, but also said it was not taking the threat lightly, particularly in view of murders in the province of Mpumalanga and elsewhere that appeared to be targeting people blowing the whistle on corruption. \"The federation will not, however, be driven to panic or paranoia by this letter. \"No amount of death threats or blackmail will cause us to scale down or abandon our campaign to end corruption,\" the federation concluded. Revelations about the death threat follow recent calls by Vavi for officials accused of corruption to be investigated. When he was asked - after reading out a statement to this effect following a Cosatu central executive committee meeting - to give examples of corrupt officials, Vavi named SA minister of communications Siphiwe Nyanda and minister of local government Sicelo Shiceka. Shiceka is reported to have faked his CV, while Nyanda has been tied to various companies that have won large government tenders - such as GNS Risk Advisory Services, of which he holds 50%. It has also been reported that Nyanda spent R500000 on accommodation at luxury Cape Town hotels while waiting for his state-owned residence to be renovated. On Thursday Nyanda threatened to sue Vavi over his utterances. Nyanda\\'s lawyers sent a letter to Vavi demanding that he publish a retraction of his \"defamatory\" statement and apologise to him for referring to him as \"a corrupt minister\". The letter, in turn, came a day after Vavi sent a strongly worded missive to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe who, it was said, was in the process of hauling the Cosatu leader over the coals for his statements. Vavi wrote to Mantashe warning that a decision to bring disciplinary charges against him - something that had reportedly been decided upon by the ANC\\'s national working committee - would create a dangerous precedent. \"This decision would imply... that any member of Cosatu or other organisations ... who join the ANC would have to disown his or her original organisation and accept only the discipline of the ANC,\" Vavi said in the letter. Nyanda\\'s lawyer, Siyabonga Mahlangu, said he had received instructions to pursue legal action against Vavi in his \"personal and official capacity\" should he not apologise by next Thursday. \"The publication of your statements ... constitutes a gross violation of our client\\'s right to his good name and reputation and is per se defamatory,\" Mahlangu wrote. \"We have been instructed to demand... that you publish ... an unqualified retraction of any reference or insinuation that our client is a corrupt individual or corrupt minister, accompanied by an unqualified apology to our client. \"We demand that you do so in the same medium and manner in which you published the defamatory remarks and advise you that you have done so before close of business on 10 June 2010, failing which we hold instructions to commence legal action against you.\" Cosatu spokesman Patrick Craven said he did not know \"anything\" about the letter. He said, however, that Nyanda\\'s lawyers had \"obviously not read\" the Cosatu statement that Vavi had quoted from, and that Nyanda and his lawyers \"obviously got it wrong\". \"He (Vavi) was reading from the statement and these were examples of ministers in the media against whom allegations have been levelled,\" Craven said. He said that at no stage did Vavi allege that the two ministers were corrupt. - Additional reporting by I-Net Bridge CREDENTIALS: The SA minister of local government, Sicelo Shiceka Picture:SOWETAN TENDERS: The SA minister of communications, Siphiwe Nyanda Picture:TREVOR SAMSON THREATS: General secretary of the Congress of SA Trade Unions, Zwelinzima Vavi Picture: RUSSELL ROBERTS\n",

      "A guiding light of township tourism Tourists are flocking to Wandu @ Ekasi, once a tiny RDP house \\'I want this township to develop its own brand and identity just like Soweto\\' WHILE five-star hotels roll out the red carpet for soccer dignitaries and stars, Mawande Kondlo is welcoming them into his bedroom - which has been converted into a township bar and restaurant. Kondlo lives in the impoverished township of Khayalethu, which overlooks Knysna where the national soccer teams from Denmark and France will be staying at luxury resorts. The 35-year-old tour guide\\'s home, once a tiny cement block RDP house, but now proudly known as Wandu @ Ekasi, is fast becoming a tourist magnet on the Garden Route. Among the guests to have dined under the cane ceiling are a Danish 2010 Fifa World Cup delegation, including the country\\'s ambassador Dan Frederiksen, Steen Dahrup, manager of the Danish national team, and Knysna mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies. \"Dahrup ate a beef roosterkoek (bread dough roasted over the coals) and asked for another one immediately. He will never forget it,\" said Kondlo. The restaurant serves South African favourites such as liver, and umphokoqo namasi (pap and sour milk). Steel plates filled with nuts and Karoo biltong welcome guests. Next week the father of two will take 20 Japanese tourists staying in George - where their national soccer team is based - on a tour to Oudtshoorn. Although the restaurant, which is still his family home, is part of a township peppered with informal wooden homes and shacks, it commands a prime piece of real estate because of its location - on a hill-top with majestic views of the Knysna Heads. Kondlo last year hosted an \"intimate wedding\" for a German couple who requested samp and beans and pap en vleis for their menu. The business is thriving and Kondlo hopes to develop the property into a guest house. He said he was inundated with calls from clients who wanted to sleep in the township. Tourists eager to experience township life had even spent the night, sleeping in his son\\'s bedroom, he said. Kondlo guides tourists around the township, to taste umqombothi (traditional beer) and to consult a local sangoma. But, he said, only about 5% of his clients were locals. \"I\\'m doing this to try to show visitors that things are changing in the township. When they drive along the N2 all they see is shacks. They don\\'t realise that there are people here and that there is development. Some even ask if it\\'s safe to come in here,\" Kondlo said. \"Most importantly I want to preserve our culture. I want this township to develop its own brand and identity - just like Soweto.\" Kondlo grew up in Oudtshoorn and moved to Knysna hoping to find a job there in 1995. He first worked as a petrol attendant and later a porter at one of the town\\'s hotels. \"I developed a love for tourism while working as a porter ... and was later promoted to night receptionist. I used to admire tour guides and tour operators at the hotel. I asked them how I could get into the industry and they said I could study. I then quit my job and opened my own tour company, taking tourists to the Cango Caves in Oudtshoorn and the Crags in Plettenberg Bay. \"I used my small Toyota Tazz but when I got more clients I had to hire a bigger vehicle,\" he said. Three teams playing in the World Cup will be based in the southern Cape. Denmark is staying at the Simola Hotel & Country Club and Spa, while France is booked into the Pezula Hotel in Knysna. Japan has elected to stay at the Fancourt Hotel & Country Club in George. Bouw-Spies said that despite Knysna hosting two World Cup teams, it was not expecting many French and Danish visitors during the tournament. \"The teams told us not to expect thousands of their supporters to come to town. But we are not worried because the benefits will be post-2010 - as well as the exposure,\" she said. nombembepsundaytimes.co.za WANTS ROOMS WITH A VIEW: Mawande Kondlo, owner of Wandu @ Ekasi resturant in Khayalethu, Knysna Picture: MOEKETSI MOTICOE\n",

      "Big dreamer out to show the world why e-commerce is the way to go Never afraid to take a chance on a viable idea, the resourceful South African entrepreneur is on his ninth tech start-up - he runs it from London but employs local programmers, writes \\'There\\'s nothing like standing in front of global thought leaders and getting inspired. It has happened to me\\' \\'I\\'VE got an idea for a business. It\\'s a niched e-commerce store,\" Gareth Knight told me shortly after I met him at a networking event called Geekretreat two years ago. Like everything with him, it was an understatement. The e-commerce project is the successful entrepreneur\\'s ninth tech start-up. At the time Knight, now 34, was trying to find a way to stay at the e-commerce coal face in London but use the expertise of programmers in SA. As part of this Knight started his own conference, called Tech4Africa, the second instalment of which finished last week. Last year the keynotes were delivered by Clay Shirky, the pre-eminent thinker on new media, and Leila Janah, who founded Samasource, a revolutionary way of finding \"microwork\" for people in the world\\'s poorest places. This year Ghanaian entrepreneur Herman Chinery-Hesse, often described as the Bill Gates of Africa, and digital strategist Josh Spear spoke at Tech4Africa. Other speakers included tech luminaries from Twitter, Yahoo!, Digg, Google, Apple, Virgin, Mozilla and Amazon. Said Knight: \"I originally wanted to create an environment where I can hire good people. The only way I can do that is expose them to global experts. There aren\\'t any in South Africa. \"And there\\'s nothing like standing in front of global thought leaders and getting inspired and going out and building things. It\\'s happened to me a few times and I hope it can happen to other people.\" Knight has dug into his own pocket to bring in the tech luminaries to South Africa. \"It has all been bootstrapped in the true sense of the word,\" he said. Bootstrapping is an unknown concept to most people outside of the tech world. It is effectively launching a new business using scarce resources and with no external funding. Knight is a master of this form of entrepreneurship. His seventh start-up (T4A would be his eighth) was Kindo. It was the world\\'s fastest- growing family-tree social website before he sold it to MyHeritage, the largest such site. As part of this year\\'s event, Knight and fellow South African entrepreneur, Vinny Lingham, gave a no-holds-barred account of their early days starting up businesses. San Francisco-based Lingham\\'s Yola.com lets its users build their own websites and it now has 6-million users as well as deals with HP and Google. In 2009 Business Week named it 19th among the top 50 global start-ups. Knight\\'s latest venture - through his company, Technovated - is a clever use of current web technologies that enables him to provide what\\'s called multi-niche e-commerce sites. As part of this he is now selling everything from mattresses to coffee tables, furniture to beds, using an e-commerce platform he built. \"Whatever we build in one store we roll out in other stores,\" Knight said. He runs it from London but employs South African programmers back at home too. But it\\'s not been easy. \"I\\'ve spoken to a lot of people who have raised money. We raised a fifth of what we should have. \"We\\'ve been pushed hard by the investors to prove it and it\\'s working. We\\'ve proven we can do it. With e-commerce you\\'ve got to have cash to bridge you over the start-up phase.\" He said he\\'s learnt invaluable lessons from his various businesses. \"The one thing I have learnt over the last year and half is perspective. I\\'ve had so many ups and downs. You can\\'t get upset at the first sign of trouble and can\\'t get excited at the first sign of success. You have to have a sense of perspective.\" Knight certainly proves that South Africa\\'s best export are South Africans themselves. TRUE MAN OF ACTION: Gareth Knight Picture: TOBY SHAPSHAK\n",

      "Club-hopping prof back on his travels NOMADIC coach \"Professor\" Mlungisi Ngubane, who has been to as many clubs as a golfer has in his bag, has dumped fifth-placed First Division club Chippa United for last-placed Atlie FC. We know he\\'s made a name as a renowned relegation-beater, but, Prof, isn\\'t this taking things a little too far? THE recycling of tired and washed-up soccer administrators continues unabated, with former SABC group executive Mvuzo Mbebe appointed CEO of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations Organising Committee. The overfed Mbebe does not inspire confidence and we\\'re wondering what vision and leadership he will bring to the organising committee. KAIZER Chiefs striker Lehlohonolo Majoro was hauled over the coals for flashing his vest with the slogan \"I do have balz\" after he scored against Moroka Swallows. For his actions he\\'s had his balls chopped off and been hit with a R10 000 fine. \"ARE you guys hungry?\" PSL media manager Altaaf \"Send Button\" Kazi this week asked the question-shy press at a Nedbank Cup press conference where snacks are traditionally served afterwards. Quite witty, Mr Kazi, quite witty - even Tsamaya was impressed. BLACK Leopards coach Vladislav Heric is having one hell of a week. His club said he didn\\'t travel to Zimbabwe for their African Confederations Cup because of visa problems and that he was also involved in a mix-up that saw him miss the flight to Durban for their league match against Golden Arrows. Heric\\'s absence has sparked rumours that he has been sacked by the club\\'s trigger-happy bosses. But a Leopards official insisted: \"He is still 100% our coach and what happened was just unfortunate.\" Tsamaya wants to remind fans that this is the same club that fired a coach after a single game in charge. POWERLINES, poor Powerlines - we can\\'t forget you lads this week, unfortunately. At the risk of adding insult to injury, we have to ask: WTF!? We hear poor goalkeeper Thabang Louw has been complaining of back pain after having to pick up the ball from his own net so many times in the 24-0 mauling by Sundowns. He is due for a spinal cord operation as soon as the power returns to the local lines. SA prodigal son Benni McCarthy was in the news this week, with fans calling on him to help resolve Bafana\\'s scoring crisis. \"You don\\'t want to be having old throngs hanging around the national team. You don\\'t want players like myself, Bhele [Siyabonga Nomvethe], [Macbeth] Sibaya and Sibusiso Zuma. We\\'re past it now,\" said McCarthy last year.

      "HOGARTH Okay, remind me who let the dogs of populism off the leash HOGARTH is pleased to see that PresidentJacob Zumahas woken up to the ills of populism, as represented by Julius Malema\\'s hijacking of the memorial service for slain workers at the Marikana mine. But let\\'s rake over the coals again. It was Zuma himself who let Malema off the leash ahead of the Polokwane conference in 2007. Back then, Julius was doing the big guy a favour by barking loudly at his opponent, Thabo Mbeki. Intemperate language was used, songs were sung about machine guns ... ah, those were the days! Malema seems to have learnt too well at his master\\'s knee. This week, he turned the memorial service into a frothy attack on the ANC, which, he said, had become pigs feeding on their own people. Drumming up little votes DELIVERING the JS Moroka Lecture in North West this week, Zuma veered from his prepared speech to emphasise the point to the audience that Moroka, who was one of the ANC presidents of the 1940s, was father to 10 children. When members of the audience started laughing, obviously drawing the link with Zuma having more than 20 children, Zuma giggled and shot back: \"He had 10 children; he understood the need for vote.\" When he\\'s a lady HOGARTH sees that the IFP\\'s Mario Oriani-Ambrosini was in fine form in parliament this week. But, considering he was speaking during Women\\'s Month, he might have chosen his words more carefully. According to the text released, he began: \"Madam house chair, minister, let us try to have a serene and a man-to-man discussion on an issue on which the whole country is trying to have some sanity and pragmatism.\" Later on, he had another gender-bending moment, saying: \"... I do because our minister is a man who has brought a gift of intellect and has her heart in the right place.\" Flattering to deceive? Gavel bangs down PARLIAMENT\\'S chief financial officer, Leslie Mondo, was dismissed with immediate effect on Friday. Said a statement: \"Mr Mondo was charged with five counts of misconduct related to financial matters. He was found guilty on four of these.\" But, wait, there\\'s more: \"The disciplinary hearing involving the secretary to parliament, Mr Zingile Dingani, is not yet concluded.\" The hearings \"follow recommendations by the auditor-general, who was asked by parliament\\'s presiding officers to investigate a salary advance of R186000 received by Mr Dingani in December 2011 for the construction of a security wall at his residence\". Well, at least somebody is watching the watchdogs. What\\'s in a name? THE Higher Education Minister, Blade Nzimande, has called on the public to assist in naming two new universities in Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape. The brief? The names should reflect attributes such as democracy, inclusiveness, growth and opportunities. Well, that\\'s easy then. Let\\'s call them the University of Political Correctness 1 and the University of Political Correctness 2. An unlikely champion HOGARTH had to choke back the tears when he read how KwaZulu-Natal death squad accused Johan Booysen described his overnight stay in police cells as \"degrading and unnecessary\". As accused number one on a list of policemen facing more than 100 charges, he could have shown a little more humility. Does he really think he can become a champion of the rights of the accused who are innocent until proven guilty? OINK, OINK: Julius Malema\n",

      "Mugabe fighting to stay put MDC up in arms as Zanu makes big changes to draft constitution Mugabe and his party fighting hard to stay in power and HARARE CORRESPONDENT PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe\\'s Zanu-PF has rewritten the draft constitution, restoring as well as increasing unlimited executive presidential powers, in a move clearly aimed at preserving the status quo favourable to its octogenarian leader. This comes as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) facilitator in Zimbabwe\\'s political dialogue to restore a legitimate government and democracy, South African PresidentJacob Zuma,is expected back in Harare soon to mediate in a fresh dispute over the draft between Mugabe and other principals in the coalition government. Zuma\\'s international advisor, Lindiwe Zulu, confirmed this week that her boss could be heading to Zimbabwe - for the second time in as many weeks - to tackle the impasse over the new constitution. A perusal of the Zanu-PF draft, a copy of which The Sunday Times has in its possession, shows that Mugabe\\'s party has also removed devolution of power entirely and deleted all references to it. The devolution of power resonates with the marginalised provinces of the Ndebele-speaking provinces of Matabeleland, which largely abandoned Zanu-PF in 2000 after the advent of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). During the constitution-making outreach exercise, residents of Matabeleland demanded devolution of power, which was captured in the Copac draft, but critics say it is surprising that Zanu-PF was going against the views of the people. Zanu-PF spin-doctors argue that the people did not demand devolution of power but decentralisation of services. The party has also removed the peace and reconciliation commission; making all indigenous languages official; the open, transparent and public interview process for the appointment of judges has been replaced with a presidential appointment system. It has introduced mandatory national youth service, something flatly rejected by Zimbabweans during the out-reach programmes. Zanu-PF has also done away with a separate Constitutional Court and decided to let the status quo remain - the Supreme Court doubles up as a Constitutional Court. Dual citizenship has been banned for those who are Zimbabwean citizens by descent or registration, and Zanu-PF has mutilated the Bill of Rights by deleting all references to democratic society. In the Zanu-PF draft, agricultural land has been redefined to include any land used for poultry, so that they would be able to take any buildings used to rear chickens. They have also taken out the presidential running mate provisions and replaced them with the current system, with the new provision that in the event of the office becoming vacant the replacement will be chosen by the president\\'s party. The party has reposed all executive authority in the president by deleting the provision, which vested it in the president and cabinet, and reconstituted the imperial presidency by restoring virtually all the current presidential powers. It has also restored the current presidential immunity provisions and the presidential power to declare war without any restraint. Zanu-PF also wants to re-introduce the unfettered powers of the president to dissolve parliament. The party has taken out the provisions requiring a law to regulate Mugabe\\'s dreaded spy agency, the Central Intelligence Organisation, and requiring the CIO to be non- partisan and professional. It has reintroduced the public protector, an office Zimbabweans found useless and unhelpful during the outreach. Both factions of the MDC have roundly rejected Zanu-PF\\'s amended draft, with Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and Welshman Ncube dismissing it as unacceptable and an insult to Zimbabweans. \"I have studied the amendments Zanu-PF has made to the draft and I am astonished at the sheer scale of disrespect, contempt, insult and audacity exhibited by the amendments,\" charged Ncube. \"In many respects, their amendments make the draft worse than the current constitution, so that we would be better off with the current constitution. Even at our most foolish, there is no way we could ever accept those amendments. \"Anyone who does so would be committing political suicide. In fact, the draft is not just an insult to us but is also a mockery of the people who took time to make representations to Copac.\" Ncube said it was clear that the Zanu-PF hawks were itching for an early election. \"And this move they have made has brought them very close to their wish to burn down the country by having a rerun of the 2008 elections,\" he said. He added that it was his belief that the moderate elements in Zanu-PF have allowed the party to tinker with the Copac draft in the \"mistaken belief that the MDC formations are so fearful of an election without reforms that we would accept not only to be insulted but also a constitution which is the worst we could possibly have\". \"It\\'s not going to happen. It\\'s time to let the dice roll the way it will. If an election without a new constitution is the only way to move forward, then let it be. On our part we are not going to betray the people\\'s struggle for a democratic constitution. We will not yield an inch. We will provide the leadership required for the people to take up the struggle at the elections. The battle lines are truly drawn,\" he said. The haggling over the draft constitution is likely to incense Zuma. At the SADC summit in Mozambique last week, regional leaders urged the Global Political Agreement principals to expedite the process by dealing with the contentious issues in the draft. After surviving initial attempts to bar him standing for re-election in the watershed elections next year through term and age limits, Mugabe has been battling to change the draft, which his Zanu-PF loyalists say will reduce him to a \"mere administrative clerk\". The Zanu-PF politburo, which was expected to meet this Wednesday, held a special session yesterday to discuss the situation, before Mugabe left for the Non-Aligned Movement meeting in Iran. Senior politburo members tried to blackmail the MDC parties, saying if they continued to reject Mugabe\\'s amendments then polls would be held under the current flawed constitution. \"If Zanu-PF is pushed into a corner, then we may consider holding elections under the present constitution,\" Zanu-PF spokesman Rugare Gumbo warned on Friday. However, Tsvangirai and Ncube rejected Mugabe\\'s proposed amendments, prompting a stalemate. Ncube said his party had already written to Zuma, new SADC chairman Mozambican President Armando Guebuza, and troika chairman Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, asking them to intervene. Kikwete and other SADC leaders hauled Mugabe over the coals in Maputo, over his attempt to impose Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara on their facilitation process. SADC leaders have now frozen Mutambara out of the process. In his report to the SADC troika meeting in Maputo, Zuma said there were suggestions to put both drafts to the vote. \"MDC-T and MDC-N are of the view that the only way forward, if there are substantial issues for renegotiation on the part of Zanu-PF, is that the current draft be put to a straight \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' referendum, or that the current draft and a Zanu-PF draft be put to a referendum,\" says Zuma\\'s report, seen by the Sunday Times. \"Alternatively the referendum includes not only a \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' vote on the constitution as a whole, but also a \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' vote on each of the clauses of the constitution with regards to which Zanu-PF has an alternative formulation.\"\n",

      "Let it ride It lies deep in the heart of battlefield country, but Spioenkop nature reserve in KwaZulu-Natal is as peaceful as it gets, writes HE was deep brown with furry flanks and neat hooves and boasted a name that sounded suspiciously like Rasputin. I hadn\\'t been on a horse in decades, but no matter. We went striding into the depths of Ezemvelo KZN\\'s Spioenkop nature reserve in the footsteps of guide Christopher Mazibuko, who seemed born in the saddle and could steer his own steed using voice and body language as much as pesky reins. For the next two hours we ambled around the grassy park that is Spioenkop, coming uncannily close to herds of zebra - \"pyjamas\", says Mazibuko - blesbok, and skittish red hartebeest. We, or rather Rasputin, clambered a rocky rise to survey a vulture hide, evidently little used. Blue wildebeest lurked in a thorny spinny; eland watched us impassively. A giraffe with its head in the clouds passed so close I was treated to an eye-level view of its dusty knees. And on the way back, my horse caught the scent of home in his nostrils and took off like a hot contender for the Durban July, depositing me back at the stables adrenalin-filled and happy. It was school holidays and a weekend, so I\\'m amazed that there wasn\\'t a whole posse of riders taking advantage of the crisp winter sunshine and the affordable rates. For some reason it was just Mazibuko and me, and I felt like a spoilt landowner surveying my farm in Africa. There was more action down by the lake. Here, a few vehicles jostled each other on the banks, while a boat traced lazy curves on the water. People were picnicking and emptying beer cans and doing their best to remove fish from the depths. But these were day visitors, and the campsites were more empty than uncrowded. The rest of the place was pure peace. The reserve consists of a skinny squiggle of land around a dam of the same name, with distant Drakensberg views. Some 4700ha support a surprising quantity of game, acacias and aloes. Giraffe crossed mini-Serengeti-like vistas and over 290 bird species have been recorded, including a plethora of cuckoos and the diminutive cuckoo finch. Later, already stiffening up from the bout in the saddle, I entered the reserve\\'s northern gate and headed for iPhika, a tiny tented camp tucked away on the bushy flanks of Spioenkop. The reserve\\'s lovely curves were bathed in late afternoon sunlight and rhino beetled away from the road as I drove by. Massive pancake footprints littered the raked dust paths as I lugged my gear to a tent - the camp is unfenced, although a steep drop down to a watering hole on one side means nothing is likely to take you by surprise as you gossip around the fire. Anything else you should be able to see coming down the path. I spent an undisturbed evening grilling dinner over the coals and only woke much later to a heavy tread - eland on the hoof. It would have been great to have spent another day ambling down the walking trail in search of bald ibis and the Iron Age cattle pens tantalisingly described in a reserve booklet. Other traces of earlier peoples remain too, like hut floors, grinding stones, stone tools and pottery shards. But there was only time for a quick dawn game drive. As I headed towards the lake, an entire family of rhino came bulldozing down the track ahead of me and sent me on my way, content. - Ç Janine Stephen GAME RIDE: Visitors can ride through the bush on horseback SEE THE PATTERN: Roaming Spioenkop on horseback allows the visitor to get up close to zebra and giraffe Pictures: JANINE STEPHEN\n",

      "Shhh, there\\'s a school on my stoep Grade 10 pupil is \\'Miss\\' to disadvantaged kids \\'I give them a lot of love\\' BIÉNNE HUISMAN TEENAGER Magdaline Lewis\\'s classroom is a concrete porch where her \"pupils\" sit on steps and overturned buckets as mongrel puppies sleep at their feet. The 17-year-old, herself a Grade 10 pupil at Dysselsdorp Secondary School, is living her dream of becoming a teacher and has taken it upon herself to help educate the children of a poverty-stricken farming community in the Little Karoo. Since 2008, she has given extra-curricular \"school classes\" in the back yard of her parents\\' two-bedroom home in Kleinhans Street in Dysselsdorp, 20km outside Oudtshoorn in the Western Cape. Her alfresco classroom is flanked by roses and a vegetable garden with carrots, green beans and a large fig tree. And the side of an old, white washing machine doubles as a blackboard. Her 17 pupils, aged five to 15, have earned reputations for academic excellence, while their singing ensemble is the toast of the township. Her daily home-schooling programme kicks off with Bible study at 3pm. This is followed by mathematics and spelling lessons, choir practice and sports activities after 5pm - from Monday to Friday. She takes the class register every day, and absent pupils are duly noted and later hauled over the coals. She is not averse to disciplining her pupils and is known to dish out a light smack to those who misbehave. \"Sometimes I smack them when they get noisy and out of hand. It is important to teach them manners. I also teach them many other things, mostly practising what they learn at school. I give them a lot of love,\" she said between lessons. And she admits: \"Yes, I want to be a teacher one day - so badly.\" Estrolita Matroos, 11, one of her pupils, said: \"Juffrou is very friendly and caring towards all the children in the class. She gives us so much. She is also very beautiful. \"In the classes, we take turns to read from the Bible. She teaches the boys to kick a ball, and we jump with a skipping rope and practise athletics here in the street.\" Magdaline\\'s parents, Karel, 51, an unemployed builder, and Miekie, 52, a former domestic worker, and sister Anneen, 22, looked on during the interview. No one in the family has formal teaching experience. Miekie said the class moved into their bedroom when it rained. \"They sit on the bed. I\\'m only too grateful, as this keeps our daughter and the other children out of harm\\'s way,\" she said. \"We\\'re very proud of Magdaline, and her pupils are doing so well, passing their grades and getting diplomas.\" Karel is desperate to find work and was stung by bees this week while collecting honey for spare cash. Dysselsdorp Secondary School principal Mercia Moses said the socio-economic circumstances of her 996 pupils and their families were dire. Most parents, she said, were unemployed or travelled far to find work. Some worked in the kitchens of Oudts-hoorn restaurants, at ostrich feather factories or on vegetable farms. For most cash-strapped residents, the R30 return taxi fare to Oudtshoorn is considered steep. \"We call Dysselsdorp a \\'grant town\\' because the parents here live off grants. Unemployment is high. The children come from broken homes,\" said Moses, adding that Magdaline was addressing a pressing need in helping others. Magdaline\\'s Grade 10A class teacher, Deidre Jantjies, said: \"Three-quarters of my children live with their grandparents. This makes homework a huge problem, as the grandparents are often illiterate and cannot help them.\" She said Magdaline had a great \"lust for life\" and was a good team worker. Fellow teacher Stefanus Marnewick, who discovered Magdaline teaching three years ago, said: \"She has a very beautiful personality, and I find it wonderful how she treats the children. She is strict with them.\" Marnewick heads the school\\'s iSchoolAfrica press team, who made a video clip that brought Magdaline and her backyard classroom to wider attention after they uploaded it on YouTube. The national Department of Rural Development donated stationery to Magdaline after viewing the video. Despite abject poverty, the township of Dysselsdorp is experiencing a baby boom. Said Marnewick: \"You see, there\\'s not a lot to do here in Dysselsdorp - and that is the problem.\" Watch Magdaline in action at www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW8K8c3wqAA SILENCE IN CLASS!

Gillian Schutte, Steve Hofmeyr and Eusebius McKaiser give very different viewpoints on a subject that continues to spark heated debate Pale, male and blind Whites seem to get away with both explicit and implicit racism in our public sphere An entire nation of people had their aspirations and dreams and normalcy systemically removed WHAT is white privilege? A sense of anxiety pervades my body as I tackle this topic again, for I know the backlash will be huge. It always is. We, the so-called rainbow nation, remain blinded by whiteness in South Africa. This is most obviously evidenced in the social furores that erupt every few months in our public sphere. It is hard not to notice how these eruptions play out along similar lines every time. What is clear is that in every instance that black persons have made a supposedly racist public slur they are dragged across the media hot-coal pit, publicly shamed, sometimes even lose their jobs and generally take a beating. Yet white people seem to get away with both explicit and implicit racism in our public sphere - often. I have yet to see white persons losing their job over a public complaint about unfair discrimination against them, or for insulting a black person in their column. It seems that to lose your job as a white bigot you need to break the cardinal rule of polite non-racist discourse and say the K-word in public. The difference is that if black persons make a legitimate complaint about the historically based hierarchical racism experienced by black people, the majority of whom remain at the bottom of this economic social hierarchy, they are accused of racism. If a black leader sings a struggle song, which is historically rooted and speaks about killing the enemy, he is taken to the Equality Court and banned from singing it. Yet just this month we saw, in public, the Red October protesters carrying posters that spoke of killing a taxi-load of black people for every one white parent killed. Nothing has been done about this blatant display of racism and threat of violence against black people in the public sphere, and many who are blinded by whiteness have refused to take this seriously. The media never dragged the leaders of this movement over the coals and demanded to know how they can host social sites that speak of blackness in the most derogatory and dehumanising terms imaginable. These are the double standards of a white-privileged dominant discourse at work. It is all about who governs the public discourse, and the white-privileged class has made sure to hold on to the dominant narrative in this country. It is the domain of the chattering class and the corporate class, facilitated by the mainstream media. But this is the privileged class\\'s best-kept secret - in fact, it is so secret that even they are unaware that a discourse of white privilege dominates our public conversations and debates. It is only when exposed that all hell breaks loose. As someone who does this regularly, I have been accused of being a self-hating white person, a black wannabe, masochistic and worse. And I am not just talking about the lunatic fringe; I am talking about academics, opinionistas, gatekeepers and human rights activists too. I have been told I want whites to hand over all their hard-earned economic privileges to \"the blacks\" and \"then I will be happy\". But privilege is not simply about wealth, although many white people will argue that they \"deserve their privilege since they worked so hard for it\". The implication is that the majority of black people are poor because they do not have the same work ethic. This is a prime example of the non-reflexivity of the privileged white discourse. It contains within it implicit racist beliefs and suggestions about black people, effectively \"othering\" them, but it does not recognise this. Let us break this down. By assuming white wealth is all about hard work, the default would be that black poverty is all about laziness. This narrative is devoid of the understanding that, historically, the indigenous population were stripped of their land, forcibly removed from family and prevented from earning a decent livelihood because they were reduced to cheap labour. All chances of a decent life were taken away by a ruthless system that forced the black population to become virtual slaves to the tiny white population - to work on the mines and farms (land that once belonged to them) and in our houses and gardens. Schools were few and far between and the education was second grade. Food was scarce and children grew up malnourished. An entire nation of people had their aspirations and dreams and normalcy systemically removed as white people grew their exclusive economy on the sweat off the black population\\'s backs. This decimation took place over three centuries. How do white persons then have the temerity to say their wealth is because of their own hard work and not factor these historical realities into the equation? How does white privilege demand of blackness that they forgive and forget when the effects of this history are still very much with us today? There, again, white privilege kicks in and creates the narrative that it is all to do with the government of the day. Well, yes, the government of the day should have stuck to the Freedom Charter and gone with a socialist development plan so that the gap between rich and poor was lessened considerably. But it did not. Instead, it appeased white people with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and then adopted a macroeconomic policy that favoured white business, built a black middle class over two decades and enriched a small percentage of elite black businessmen. Not only that, but this system also allowed the government to become part of the elite. This, it seems, was a wily move on the part of white business because it has ensured the government is constantly in the \"corruption spotlight\", whereas the white corporate elite continue to live obscenely lavish lifestyles. They fall under the radar. They remain criticism-free. We are busy blaming the government for its greed and all the ills of society, including, it would seem, historical ills. The government must be criticised for falling into this trap and letting down the majority as it sups with the corporate class. But why should the corporate class get off scot-free as it continues to live opulently off the land\\'s resources and could not care less about the growing gap between rich and poor? The white privileged class is so sure of its moral high ground and superiority that it will continue to deride a government under which it has grown richer in the past two decades, as statistics have shown. This is indicative of collective white privilege at play in the dominant discourse. But dare talk about it or, worse, write about it and you will be metaphorically \"twittered and feathered\" and shamed for your observations. The misogynistic vitriol that you will be subject to is beyond the pale and mostly from furious pale males. Either this is because social gatekeeping is historically a male domain and how dare a mere woman take up space, or it is because you have simply said what these gatekeepers will not say. But mostly it is because we remain a nation that is blinded by whiteness, and therein lays the conundrum of the invisibility of white privilege in South Africa. Picture: RUVAN BOSHOFF\n",

      "Thanks be to God for giving us such a superb gift He was an icon of forgiveness and reconciliation with unassailable moral stature, writes Had a lesser mortal been our president, perhaps we might not have made the transition so relatively peacefully and the TRC might not have happened - or it would have had an even rougher ride GOD must love South Africa especially to have given us so many wonderful people: Beyers Naudé, Bram Fischer, Helen Joseph, Lilian Ngoyi, Mangaliso Sobukwe, Steve Biko, Walter Sisulu, Yusuf Dadoo and many others. And then, to top it off, God gave us this truly remarkable man,Nelson Mandela,who became a legend in his lifetime. Without him we almost certainly would not have made the near-miraculous transition from repression to democracy so relatively peacefully. I metNelson Mandelafor the first time in the early \\'50s. He was adjudicating a debating contest between those of us from the Bantu Normal College (presumably for normal Bantu whose student residences were rondavels, no doubt to help us develop along our own lines!) and the Jan Hofmeyr School of Social Work. He probably was a good judge because our team won. My next encounter with him was in 1990 when he was released from Victor Verster Prison and came to spend his first night of freedom at Bishopscourt, the archbishop of Cape Town\\'s official residence, when I was the incumbent. The government had refused me permission to visit either Robben Island or the other maximum-security prisons. Mandela did write to me to thank me for whatever it was that I had, in his view, done for Winnie and the children. In 1988 I had addressed a huge crowd of about 250000 at Hyde Park Corner, London. Many had come as pilgrims from every quarter of the British Isles at the invitation of Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, then chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, to celebrate Madiba\\'s 70th birthday. Most of those present had not been born when he was sentenced to life imprisonment. They had not seen nor heard him speak and yet they came in their droves to celebrate what Archbishop Trevor declared must be Madiba\\'s last birthday in prison. Not bad, for two years later he was out of prison. On February 11 1990, the day Mandela was released, we saw little of him at Bishopscourt because he was closeted with his ANC colleagues - and frequently interrupted: \"There\\'s a call from the White House\" or \"State House in Lusaka\". Quite a few people were worried that his reputation while in jail had become that of a moral giant and that it would turn out that he had feet of clay. There were those who did not want him released lest we all suffer from a monumental letdown when it turned out that he was but a fallible mortal. We need not have worried. He was, like many of us, deeply distressed at the carnage that was happening in the black community - the so-called black-on-black violence. Many of us believed it was being fuelled by a sinister third force intent on scuppering the delicate negotiations for transition from repression to democracy. The situation was particularly desperate in the killing fields of KwaZulu-Natal and on the East Rand, in the horrendous bloodletting between the ANC and the IFP. Madiba was firmly convinced that F W de Klerk could have stopped the violence but was callously indifferent because black lives were of little value to him. His rare flashes of anger were reserved for De Klerk\\'s apparent indifference and led to the suspension of the Codesa talks after the Boipatong massacre. Madiba was ready to do virtually anything within reason to stop the internecine carnage. Then it happened that the Bishop of the Methodist Church, Dr Stanley Mogoba, and I convened the Kempton Park Summit between Madiba and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the IFP, who had announced that his party would boycott our first democratic elections. You did not need to be clairvoyant to predict that the intended boycott would almost certainly lead to a huge loss of life, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal. I was amazed at the concessions that Madiba was prepared to make. The IFP demanded that it be recognised as a legitimate liberation movement and not continue to be vilified as an ethnic Bantustan collaborator with the apartheid regime. Buthelezi wanted to address political rallies together with Madiba. Many in the ANC regarded that as anathema, as something that would give the IFP a credibility it did not deserve. And it would create the impression that the two leaders were equal in stature. The IFP also insisted on the right to carry so-called traditional weapons. Madiba gave in on all these points. He even went on to say that although he had not consulted his colleagues on this particular point, if the ANC won the election he would appoint Buthelezi to a very senior cabinet position such as minister of foreign affairs. All he was asking for in exchange was that the IFP agree on the proposed election date and to participate in it. The response was negative on both those points. That summit showed me the lengths to which Madiba was prepared to go to achieve a goal he considered important. It all paled in comparison with what he was to show the world as president. Many had expected that the advent of a black-led government would be the signal for an orgy of retribution and revenge. Instead, the world was awed by the spectacle of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where the victims of atrocities revealed a remarkable nobility of spirit and magnanimity in their willingness to forgive their former tormentors. We were richly blessed that Madiba was at the helm of our ship of state. He showed us the way by example and thus established his place in the world as an icon of forgiveness and reconciliation with unassailable moral stature. Who will ever be able to calculate what his various conciliatory gestures contributed to nation-building and unity? He invited his former white jailer, as a VIP guest, to attend his inauguration as president. He invited to lunch Percy Yutar, the prosecutor in the Rivonia Trial who had asked for the death sentence to be passed on Madiba and his comrades, and he visited Betsie Verwoerd, the widow of Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect and high priest of apartheid. In a gesture that would have been gauche from anyone else, he wore the Springbok jersey during the Rugby World Cup final in 1995. And when we beat the All Blacks, something that would have been unthinkable just a few years before took place: black South Africans celebrated the victory in the townships, victory in a sport that for so long had been identified with their arch-oppressor. Had a lesser mortal been our president, perhaps we might not have made the transition so relatively peacefully and the TRC might not have happened - or it would have had an even rougher ride than it actually experienced. This was a truly great man who believes fervently that a leader exists for the sake of the led. I had lunch with him once in Houghton and at the end he saw me to the door and called out \"driver\", meaning my driver. I said I had driven myself from Soweto. He said nothing. A few days later he rang me to say he had not consulted me but had been concerned that I was driving myself, so he had phoned one of his rich business friends who had agreed to send me a large monthly grant to pay for a driver. It was this passion that made him work tirelessly to raise funds for schools and clinics. It was second nature to him and so he kept up a punishing schedule. He believed so fervently that people really mattered that he stopped to shake hands with people, however lowly their station. For him they counted. The people warmed to his love for them and loved him in return. You just had to see the reception he received everywhere, the adulation and hero worship. He enjoyed it like a little child and seemed so surprised that people should react in this fashion. I could pick up the phone to raise whatever issue was causing me concern, especially with the TRC, and he would say, \"Come over for breakfast or lunch\" and we would sort it out. Maybe he liked me a bit - even when I criticised his lack of sartorial taste over those shirts and he retorted that I was hardly one to speak when I wore dresses in public. He asked me to be his envoy to try to persuade the Nigerian president, Sani Abacha, to release his political opponent, Moshood Abiola. I failed in my mission, although I was permitted to see Abiola under house arrest. When a TRC commissioner was being investigated by a judicial commission for alleged complicity in a gross offence, the subject of an amnesty application, Madiba wanted to put him out of the misery of waiting for the report. I told the president\\'s secretary that I was upset as I should be the first, as TRC chairman, to know the contents of the report. A few minutes later the president was on the line. \"Yes, Mpilo (my Xhosa name, which means \\'life\\'), you\\'re quite right. I\\'m sorry.\" Perhaps it is only the truly great who have the humility to say sorry. Most politicians avoid it like the plague. He loved Winnie deeply. They visited our Soweto house soon after his release to enjoy Xhosa cuisine and you could see how he followed her every movement with his eyes. He was hurting very much and told me some things that a man does not usually tell another man about his wife. It was a huge blow to him when the break happened. He admired her for all she had accomplished despite harassment from the state and for how she had single-handedly brought up their two daughters. It was wonderful when Graça came into his life. He blossomed and was like a teenager in love for the first time. Both of them deserved the joy they brought to each other. He was good; when I hauled him over the coals for \"shacking up\" with her and giving our youth a bad example, they promptly got married. They became a wonderful advert for love and marriage. At (now Minister of Justice) Jeff Radebe\\'s wedding, I caught Graça removing perhaps an imaginary piece of fluff from his shirt. When he was alone for a bit, I went over to him and said: \"Yu \\'ndoda lamfazi uyaku thanda he (I saw her dusting you off).\" He retorted excitedly: \"Did you see that?\" I was thrilled for them. What a magnificent gift. The best we can do is to emulate him and make a scintillating success of our land, caring especially for the most vulnerable and seeking to be as altruistic as he is. Thanks be to God for giving us such a superb gift, the father of our rainbow nation.

      "M& R \\'fobbed off\\' whistle-blower Paper trail points to series of dire warnings on collusion and corruption SENSATIONAL new documents show that despite its heated denials Murray & Roberts\\' top brass were well-aware of corruption in the construction industry for many years. The documents, obtained by Business Times reporters, call into question the \"public apology\" from CEO Henry Laas, reported in this newspaper last year, and the view of his predecessor, Brian Bruce, who called the collusion the actions of \"rogue hoods\". Laas and Bruce, who led Murray & Roberts for more than a decade, claim they were not aware of any collusion, implying that only junior officials were involved. Murray & Roberts was fined R309-million for its role in 17 acts of collusion, including working on the R4.5-billion Green Point Stadium for the 2010 World Cup. It was one of the largest offenders, as 18 major construction firms were fined R1.46-billion. Murray & Roberts colluded with other firms, including Stefanutti Stocks, Aveng and WBHO, to rip off the public on a large number of projects, including construction of the Green Point Stadium and the Gautrain and the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project, for which e-tolls are now being levied on consumers. Yet none of the executives has yet been charged or fired. Junior employees are carrying the can. Today\\'s revelations raise sharp questions about how seriously large JSE-listed corporations treat whistle-blowers with evidence of corruption. One Murray & Roberts insider, who worked as a senior manager at the coal face where the collusion took place, wrote a letter to Bruce on January 31 2007, detailing incidents in which collusion and corruption had taken place. This letter to Bruce was sent at the time when construction firms were bidding for World Cup stadium projects. The first time he blew the whistle on shady activities at the company was two years before. Yet Murray & Roberts did not admit publicly to any collusion for many years. In its 2013 annual report, Laas said that \"since the first of these matters came to light in 2008, the board and executive has left no stone unturned in our efforts to rid the group of any such practices\". In response to questions this week, Murray & Roberts spokesman Ed Jardim rejected the suggestion it had ignored the tip-off. He said the group had been \"proactive in investigating and rooting out any alleged wrongful conduct. The collusive conduct came about as a result of the unauthorised actions of certain subsidiary managers ... no longer with the group.\" But the insider, who did not want to be named as he still works in the industry and feared being persecuted, said that Murray & Roberts failed to root out the shady practices when first alerted. \"Nothing ever came from my efforts or letters to try and alert the necessary people to the corruption that was ongoing,\" he said. His letters detail 15 incidents in which he could show collusion had taken place, dating back to 2001. In an affidavit he subsequently gave to the police, he detailed kick-backs to sub-contractors, the existence of a \"slush fund\", extortion and unjustified payments to consultants. In one such letter to Murray & Roberts in February 2006, he detailed how the top five construction firms held \"regular strategy meetings\", attended by the managing directors, to \"allocate the various mega projects on offer amongst the various members of the club\" - including the contract to build the Cape Town Convention Centre. At its AGM last year, Murray & Roberts finally admitted to collusion in the tender for that convention centre. In another project, he described how \"a few days before [the] submission of the tender, we would telephonically inform the other members what their submitted price had to be, which had been predetermined by us\". Yet this method of \"cover pricing\" was publicly revealed only last year, as part of the Competition Commission probe, years after he had first informed Murray & Roberts. The criminal case collapsed mainly, the insider said, because the police did not receive proper assistance from Murray & Roberts. Yet the corruption continued, and reached a peak a few months later, when the World Cup tenders were being rolled out. In one letter to Murray & Roberts in 2007, the whistle-blower said he \"had to endure open and subtle threats\" by other staff, before he eventually quit. When he asked why nothing was happening to eradicate this behaviour, Murray & Roberts\\' lawyer, Millard Arnold, sent him a letter in February 2007, saying \"the delays, if any, in pursuing your complaint rests entirely in the hands of the SAPS and National Prosecuting Authority\". In recent months, Millard has publicly stated he was unaware of corrupt practices at the company. Yet this letter raises questions over whether Murray & Roberts was as thorough in seeking to root out corruption. Jardim said it did everything it could, even hiring lawyers and forensic experts to probe the claims relating to the Cape building business between 2001 and 2004. \"We have a long and proven history of cooperation with the authorities,\" he said. He said it was one of the first construction firms to \"proactively commence a comprehensive internal review of its operations\". But the source is not the sole whistle-blower with evidence of poor ethical conduct at Murray & Roberts. New evidence has emerged from a former Murray & Roberts employee named Corrie Gordon in which he alerted the company to the shady activities. In a letter and e-mail, dated August 30 2010, Gordon wrote to Laas alerting him to the possibility of corrupt and unethical practices. At the time, Laas was MD of Murray & Roberts\\' cementation division before replacing Bruce in the top job in 2011. \"All they did was sent me from pillar-to-post, organising meetings and then cancelling again ... I never actually had a meeting with Laas or the HR manager, Theunis Mienie, who I was pawned off on, because they decided I was a disgruntled employee,\" he told Business Times this week. Gordon highlighted suspicious activities during Murray & Roberts\\' building of a massive mining shaft for Impala Platinum in 2004 - in that case shaft number 20. He worked as a planner on the project and, after it became clear that the construction was falling behind, he produced a plan to limit the delays on the delivery of the shaft. The main shaft and the ventilation shaft were supposed to be delivered at the same time. But, according to Gordon, Murray & Roberts stopped working on the ventilation shaft to ensure the main shaft was delivered on time - only because there was a bonus for doing so on this part of the project. But after this bonus was collected, said Gordon, the rest of project was deliberately \"stretched\" out, and ended up being 400 days late. \"When I started to ask questions about why my plan was not being used, I was simply demoted and then retrenched. When I asked for meetings to discuss the issues I was ignored,\" said a sombre-looking Gordon. Murray & Roberts rejects Gordon\\'s claims, saying it did try and meet him. It claimed Gordon was demoted because he didn\\'t have the skills to fulfil his job as a site planner, and was retrenched as part of a wider redundancy process.

      "Nando\\'s finds shirking claims too spicy The media is exposing those who plan for tax aggressively ARGUABLY SA\\'s most successful export, Portuguese-style chicken chain Nando\\'s is in the spotlight after Britain\\'s Guardian newspaper claimed it may be shirking its full tax burden with an unnecessarily complex and opaque structure. The paper claimed the owner of Nando\\'s, South African insurance tycoon Dick Enthoven, used a secretive R13.78-billion trust in the Channel Islands to collect royalties and other payments from Nando\\'s franchises through a complicated web of offshore structures. The wealthy Enthoven family also owns insurance company Hollard and wine estate Spier. Nando\\'s structures - which make use of accounting devices in tax havens such as Malta, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Luxembourg - \"significantly reduce the amount of tax the company and the family pay around the world\", the article said. The owners of Nando\\'s \"also legally reduce their UK corporate tax bill by making various permissible payments offshore. Nando\\'s does then pay UK corporation tax on the remainder of its profits.\" But Nando\\'s UK hit back, saying it paid more than R220-million to the UK exchequer in corporate tax last year - 23% of its operating profit. \"Nando\\'s is a family business. It\\'s still owned and run by the people who founded a single chicken shop in South Africa and have grown it to become a global company with 1050 restaurants in 22 countries,\" it said. \"Serving chicken in so many different places does make our parent group\\'s financial structure complex, but we have always been open and honest about the tax we pay in the UK.\" While the Guardian suggested Nando\\'s could be liable for up to 50% more tax than it paid, a Nando\\'s spokesman rubbished this idea. No company in the UK paid 33% corporation tax, he said, which was what Nando\\'s would have to pay with that suggestion. Deborah Tickle, KPMG\\'s director for international corporate tax, said every company was allowed to structure its affairs to be most tax-efficient. \"There is no obligation to pay more than the tax required. What many countries have done is put in place what they call impermissible tax-avoidance legislation, so certain types of avoidance are not acceptable, where there is no commercial rationale behind a transaction.\" But so far Nando\\'s appears to have done nothing illegal. Tickle said these structures were typical not just for the extremely wealthy but for individuals with far fewer assets. \"Assets can be put into a trust for all sorts of reasons,\" she said. But authorities are trying to clamp down on complexity and stop tax base erosion and \"profit shifting\", where companies make profit in one country and shift the cash somewhere else where they are taxed less. While companies can pay only what they\\'re asked to, there is a caveat. \"Reputational risk is an issue, and the media is exposing those who plan for tax aggressively. The Starbucks case is well known here. We\\'re seeing an awareness of it in our clients now, and there\\'s been a definite reduction in appetite for doing something out of the norm,\" Tickle said. Starbucks was hauled over the coals for paying no tax until it was forced to in 2013 - despite its mega UK sales. The South African Revenue Service is only an interested bystander right now. It said that if the Guardian\\'s assumptions were true, the article \"encapsulates the inherent challenges confronting tax administrations regarding base erosion and profit shifting\".\n",

      "The Last Word. . Avoid Lonmin like the Bermuda Triangle THERE\\'s more than one reason why investors would do well to steer clear of Lonmin, the world\\'s third-largest platinum company. Lonmin, headquartered in London but mining solely in the Bushveld complex, is the fine institution that brought you the era-defining slaughter at its Marikana mine in 2012. Fast-forward two years, and what is Lonmin doing now? Well, it turns out it is trying to gag critics with \"interdicts\", ignoring shareholders and claiming that its evidence to the Farlam commission on Marikana is secret. It wasn\\'t meant to be like that. When 46-year-old Ben Magara, Anglo Coal\\'s highly rated boss, took over from Ian Farmer as CEO in July last year, people crossed their fingers, hoping that he would dial back years of shoddy leadership. Magara told journalists his management style was to \"get to the coalface\". \"My approach is to get to know the people and they will tell me what needs to be done,\" he told one. And yet, Magara\\'s \"new Lonmin\" is anything but keen to engage. Two weeks ago, a nongovernmental group, the Alternative Information and Development Centre (AIDC), said it would release a report, drawn from evidence at the Farlam commission, on how Lonmin ships profits through Bermuda, a tax haven. So what did Magara\\'s company do? It dashed to court for an interdict to stop the AIDC and its Swedish economist, Dick Forslund, from \"presenting or publishing in any form whatsoever, any report based on information disclosed in the course of the [Marikana] hearings\". In its application, Lonmin argued that the evidence given to Farlam was \"confidential\". And the AIDC, it said, was \"clearly aiming to disseminate information that could only have been derived from the commission\". Imagine the chutzpah. How dare the AIDC try to place the results of a public commission, set up so the public would know why Marikana happened, in the public domain? You can see why Lonmin is aghast. In the end, the interdict case did not happen. Lonmin reached an out-of-court deal with Forslund to delay the report - which was eventually released this week anyway. Forslund\\'s report makes for interesting reading - but that isn\\'t the issue. Rather, it is the bullyboy tactics of a company using its financial muscle to pull the shutters closed. Lonmin spokeswoman Sue Vey defended this position by saying the AIDC report contained \"conclusions drawn on the evidence, and that\\'s Farlam\\'s responsibility\". Forslund, for one, doesn\\'t buy it. He said: \"Surely this is part of the national healing process that people discuss this? These documents were tabled as public information at the Farlam commission, so how can Lonmin claim it is \\'confidential\\'?\" But it is not just tree-hugging hipsters who Lonmin has a problem with. It turns out it doesn\\'t have much time for its own shareholders either. One shareholder, the Cape Town-based asset manager Northstar, got so frustrated at the perpetual brushoffs that it took the unusual step of writing an open letter to Lonmin, imploring it to please answer the phone, return an e-mail, anything. The letter, dated October 6 and sent to Magara, said that, since February, its analysts had been asking for pretty important information. \"No response was forthcoming,\" it said. So Northstar changed tack, arranging a meeting for September 4 with Magara and executive Simon Scott through one of Lonmin\\'s banks. Two analysts flew to Lonmin\\'s fancy HQ in Johannesburg\\'s Melrose Arch to meet them, but \"the meeting was cancelled at the last moment\". Perhaps we can understand why. After all, there were some pretty important issues to discuss - such as how has Lonmin\\'s cash flow recovered from the five-month strike, its sizable debt and the board\\'s competence. Speaking this week, Northstar MD Adrian Clayton said Lonmin had since \"apologised, engaged us and answered our questions\". The thing is, Northstar has not had this experience with any other JSE-listed company. \"It\\'s not something we\\'re used to,\" Clayton said. \"Our concern was that it was quite opaque and we needed to understand what is going on.\" You would imagine that the least you could do if you were Magara - who took home R12.5-million for three months\\' work last year - is try to placate shareholders. Especially given that since July 2007 Lonmin\\'s share price has plunged 90% from R332.87 to R32.77 - not exactly a rousing sign of investor confidence. So much for Magara\\'s pledge of open arms, and how he loves \"getting to know the people\".\n",

Bid to forge agreement to end hostilities founders as opposition battles to speak with one voice Maimane under fire in DA over peace deal Caucus up in arms over leader\\'s \\'soft approach\\' to Ramaphosa We have no \\'Luthuli House culture\\' in the DA THE political deal brokered by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa this week to temper hostilities in parliament came unstuck after DA parliamentary leader Mmusi Maimane faced rebukes from within his caucus. The Sunday Times can reveal that the deal began unravelling on Tuesday after senior DA MPs expressed disagreement over the nature of the pact with Ramaphosa. Maimane, they said, went into the meeting without consulting colleagues, and emerged with nothing but vaguely worded promises. But Maimane has sought to downplay the criticisms, saying he had the support of most party members, and that the DA caucus was a place for \"frank and vigorous\" debates. At this stage, there seems to be no revolt against his leadership, especially after the ANC\\'s hardline politics forced opposition parties to unite. \"Mmusi is our parliamentary leader. Currently, we have no alternative. If he fails, we all fail,\" one DA MP said. Nevertheless, several DA MPs criticised Maimane for agreeing to the terms of Ramaphosa\\'s peace deal on Tuesday, saying he failed to maintain opposition unity after police stormed into the National Assembly. \"I\\'d hate to think he [Ramaphosa] is doing to Mmusi what he did to Roelf Meyer,\" said one prominent MP, referring to Ramaphosa\\'s negotiating tactics during the democratic transition. \"Well, we\\'ve certainly lost our swagger,\" said another DA MP. The MPs felt Maimane revealed a lack of experience and could have driven a harder bargain over President Jacob Zuma\\'s failure to appear in the House and allegations of bias on the part of Speaker Baleka Mbete. The ANC and opposition parties held a meeting on Tuesday night, with the ruling party represented by Gerhard Koornhof (parliamentary councillor to Ramaphosa), ANC Chief Whip Stone Sizani, Deputy Justice Minister John Jeffery and Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. DA MPs included Maimane, Mike Waters, John Steenhuisen and Geordin Hill-Lewis. The ANC wanted the DA to withdraw the motion to censure Zuma, and Maimane seemed to agree, but the rest of the DA delegation refused. The eventual outcome has been variously interpreted. The DA claimed it was decided that the motion would be discussed the next day. The ANC said they agreed that the motion would be softened or withdrawn. Each side has since accused the other of bad faith. Shortly after the deal fell apart, DA MPs met at an extraordinary caucus meeting. At least three MPs raised concerns and Maimane was hauled over the coals, but there was also support for his concern that parliament continued to function. DA MPs were also unhappy that Maimane had agreed to serve as co-deputy of a cross-party political discussion committee, a move they said would blur the lines separating the executive from the legislature. Pressures from within the party also explain why Maimane forged ahead with his motion to censure Zuma on Wednesday, which took both Ramaphosa and the ANC by surprise after the apparent agreement. On Friday Maimane confirmed that the initial agreement had caused disquiet in his party, but he said he had the support of most party members. \"I took the caucus through the agreement and what had been negotiated, and the whole caucus was supportive, he said. \"In the DA, we don\\'t expect that every member of the caucus must blindly follow the instructions of the party leadership. \"We have no \\'Luthuli House culture\\' in the DA. Our caucus is always a place of frank and vigorous debate, and that is exactly how we like it to be.\" DA leader Helen Zille said she had no say in the matter and that Maimane needed nobody\\'s mandate when he met Ramaphosa. \"He went in there with no mandate. He\\'s quite capable as the parliamentary leader to make up his mind as to how to proceed with the DA\\'s mandate.\"\n",

      "THE MARIKANA REPORT. Poorly trained police under fire \\'Can\\'t even disarm someone with an axe without bloodshed\\' THE SAPS\\'s public order police and other units are so ill-equipped and inadequately trained that if a crowd were to storm the Union Buildings they would be unable to stop them. This damning finding and several other deficiencies in the police were among those included in retired Judge Ian Farlam\\'s report. Farlam, who headed the Marikana commission, was scathing on the conduct of the police during the events of August 2012, and has recommended that officers be charged criminally. The report includes a part where Cees de Rover, a police expert called by the SAPS, told of an incident where public order police members \"ran away from the scene during the attack by the strikers upon their colleagues\", which he had described as the \"abject failure\" of public order policing. \"[De Rover] said the strikers on the 13th, and more so on the 16th, appeared confrontational, organised, mobile, armed, violent and volatile. \"He went so far as to say that none of the units in the SAPS has the ability to stop a crowd with those characteristics if they decided to walk into the Union Buildings,\" says the report. Based on this and other evidence led during the Marikana commission, Farlam called for the total overhaul of public order policing using local and international experts. Farlam hauled the public order police over the coals for using automatic rifles, saying that experts were unanimous in their view that such heavy weaponry was not suitable for public order policing. \"De Rover testified that he suggested an immediate withdrawal of the R5 from [public order policing] operations. He said that military assault weapons have no place in law enforcement and that he was fully aware of the particular problems of violence in South Africa,\" the report states. The evidence indicated that R5 bullets tend to disintegrate when entering the body. The commission also found that police could not even disarm someone with an axe without involving bloodshed. The commission was mindful of the dangers inherent in the situation when public order police members were faced with a crowd armed with sharp weapons and where nonlethal force was ineffective. \"However, the use of [an] R5 or any automatic rifle is clearly untenable, not only because of the constitutional imperatives, but also because the effects seen at Marikana are just too disturbing and devastating for South Africa even to contemplate any recurrence,\" says the report. In his recommendations, Farlam called for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) to investigate the police action in Marikana. Farlam recommended that, for the purposes of the investigation, \"a team should be appointed, headed by a senior state advocate, together with independent experts in the reconstruction of crime scenes, expert ballistic and forensic pathologist practitioners and senior investigators from Ipid, and any such further experts as may be necessary\". He also called for a full investigation by the North West director of public prosecutions. \"The director of public prosecutions [will] exercise his powers ... to supervise, direct and co-ordinate a specific investigation into the events at scenes one and two.\" The report says the officers who fired shots at the strikers \"may have exceeded the bounds of self- and private defence\". Farlam also slammed the lack of medical assistance for injured miners and recommended that all police units be trained in first aid. He said the commission recommended a full investigation, under the direction of the director of public prosecutions, to ascertain criminal liability on the part of all members of the SAPS who were involved in the events. On police equipment, Farlam recommended that all radio communications be recorded and the recordings preserved. All police helicopters should be equipped with functional video cameras, he said. olifantn@sundaytimes.co.za VOLATILE SITUATION: Mineworkers armed with traditional weapons attempt to overrun a police Nyala at Marikana on August 16 2012 .

      "Poor judgment writ large as candidates vie for the bench WHILE many \"exemplary candidates\" applied this week to become high court judges, some of those before the Judicial Service Commission in Cape Town seemed to be less than ideal for the job. PERCIVAL MASETI THE past came back to haunt Maseti when he was hauled over the coals on Monday for not disclosing a previous conviction for accepting a bribe while a prosecutor. Maseti, who applied for a seat at the High Court in Johannesburg, was paid R50 by a man charged with assault, more than 35 years ago. Maseti was sentenced to six months in prison. He claimed this was partially due to the political climate at the time. He said he had been kicked out of university and had to become a prosecutor. He told the JSC: \"It is my contention that the purpose of the court sentencing me was not to punish me but to allow me to cool down, relax and consider my future and undergo corrective training in terms of character and to make sure that in the future I operate above board and, in a nutshell, this was a wake-up call.\" He said since that incident he was \"a new-born, a new man\". MANDLA MBONGWE MBONGWE, also up for the Gauteng division, was nailed on Monday for his conduct as a trial judge by both the bar council and the commission. In a very \"unusual move\" the Supreme Court of Appeal slated the \"unacceptable manner\" in which Mbongwe had conducted a domestic violence case in which a woman sued the minister of police. The appeal court\\'s deputy president, Judge Mandisa Maya, said the court was \"horrified\" by Mbongwe\\'s \"unwarranted interruptions\" in the case, which bordered on discourtesy and \"cynicism\" towards witnesses and counsel. PETER FISCHER THE nephew of the late Bram Fischer did not live up to his uncle\\'s reputation. On Wednesday he interviewed for a position in the Free State division of the high court. Asked \"Why does gender equity matter?\", the advocate responded in a way that left spectators cringing. \"Hell hath no fury like a [woman scorned] ... but sometimes women are more level-headed and inclined to be much less agitated,\" he said. He also said that while men were egotistical, \"women bring balancing and a placating atmosphere to that reality\". He added that \"women bring a soft, motherly approach\". SHANAAZ MIA ON Wednesday, magistrate Mia, who applied for the Free State division of the high court, was quizzed on whether she helped a colleague to write her judgments. Mia denied doing so, saying she merely made comments and suggestions. The commission revealed that the colleague she is said to have assisted, magistrate Judith van Schalkwyk, is facing an inquiry by the Magistrate\\'s Commission. Van Schalkwyk is charged with misconduct, including gambling during office hours, instructing subordinates to do her hair, and getting others to write her judgments for her.

      "Ties with Israel \\'normal\\' as ANC roasted RELATIONS with Israel have not been strained, says South Africa\\'s ambassador to Israel, Sisa Ngombane, despite a senior diplomat being hauled over the coals after a recent meeting between Hamas and the ANC. Ngombane\\'s political adviser, Musa Marawu, was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tel Aviv on Monday to be read the riot act over the ANC\\'s hosting of Hamas leaders on a week-long visit to South Africa. Israeli foreign affairs deputy director-general Yoram Elron told Marawu, who stood in for Ngombane as the ambassador was down with flu, that his government was \"shocked, dismayed and disappointed\" by the ANC\\'s decision to meet a party Israel regards as a terrorist body. Diplomatic sources in Pretoria say Elron further accused the South African government of sending \"contradictory messages\" to Israel by encouraging negotiations between it and Palestine \"while on the other hand engaging Hamas\", a party \"committed to the eradication and destruction\" of Israel. In June, President Jacob Zuma appointed former deputy foreign affairs minister Aziz Pahad as his presidential envoy to Israel and Palestine in a bid to revive stalled negotiations. On Monday, Hamas leaders, including its chief, Khaled Meshaal, met Zuma and senior ANC leaders at Luthuli House. Since the ANC was the ruling party, Elron told Marawu, the meeting was akin to the South African government meeting Hamas. The ANC has defended its decision, saying this was in line with its policy of showing solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for statehood. Elron lodged a formal protest with Marawu and told him to convey to the South African government that Israel saw the ANC\\'s meeting with Hamas as the government\\'s embrace of a \"terrorist group\". But Marawu is said to have told Elron that Israel\\'s accusations were unfounded as Hamas had met the ANC, not the South African government. Ngombane on Friday played down the fallout over Israel, saying relations between the two countries remained cordial. \"I think it was a misunderstanding on their part, but it is just playing politics to criticise the government when in reality it was the ANC that met Hamas. We know they view Hamas as a terrorist organisation, but in negotiations every party must be engaged,\" said Ngombane. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said his party had met Hamas to find solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \"If you want a solution on the Palestinian question, you talk to everybody. Then you\\'ll find a solution. If you want a solution that excludes others, you will not find a solution,\" he said. The South African Jewish Board of Deputies said the ANC should use its contact with Hamas to urge the organisation \"to abandon terrorism and violence and commit ... to a process of peaceful negotiations\". Chairwoman Mary Kluk said the ANC was \"in a position to influence the Hamas leadership in abandoning inflammatory and profoundly racist notions\".

      "Fire. Impetuous president fails to put SA first THE sun is about to set on what has been a very turbulent year. Our business-as-usual atmosphere has been shaken up by the mayhem caused by PresidentJacob Zumawhen he changed finance ministers twice in four days. We will never forget that. It was dramatic, outrageous and an epic failure of leadership whose impact continues to be felt. Although the capricious markets have slowly settled, there is no doubt that South Africa bled. Those in denial have concocted political conspiracy theories, pitting capitalists and the West against our poor nation. Regardless of the stark evidence, they have refused to see the simple truth that we suffered because of our president\\'s ineptitude. In firing former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, Zuma indeed used his prerogative - as if that was ever the debate - but he did not use it to put South Africa first. South Africans all have their own views about the worst moments of that disorderly week. For some the worst was when Nene was fired by a dull president whose communication skills need serious intervention. At that point, Zuma did not think that he owed anyone an explanation for this extraordinary decision. Two days later, three press statements were issued in one day. The worst for some was the immediate and continued tumbling of the markets and near annihilation of our currency. For others, the appointment of little-known David van Rooyen to this crucial post and his first speech about \"demystifying the Treasury\\' were the lowest points. For me, the nadir came a few hours before Zuma announced the shifting of Pravin Gordhan back to finance from co-operative governance. It confirmed once and for all that our president simply does not understand what is going on. It would be slightly comforting if he had grasped the unfolding events, but he had chosen to ignore them in pursuit of his ambitions. But the situation is worse because it is a combination of ambition, impetuousness and lack of ability. On that Sunday, before announcing Gordhan\\'s reappointment to the Treasury, a smug president addressed a gathering in Mpumalanga where he told people to ignore those who \"talk too much on television\". This complicates the argument of Lindiwe Zulu, minister of small business development, that business does not communicate. Business, civil society and academia amplified their voice - but Zuma was not listening. Instead, he told his audience to also switch off. And there are many business leaders who have been roasted for daring to criticise the government, but that is a conversation for another day. Instead of listening to the four days of discontent, Zuma idiotically stuck to his guns and said ministers were never removed or appointed for no reason. He missed the fact that his reasons had been costly and Nene\\'s yet-to-be-defined role at a Brics bank counted for less than the market stability and economic growth for which South Africa is desperate. As the tremors were still being felt, he was the only one who still did not get it. That is depressing. A lot has happened since - the governing party intervened, denied intervening, admitted intervening, blamed business for Zuma\\'s tardy management of the country and criticised the media - but failed to put the spotlight on the main protagonist. We are entering a crucial year of local government elections. This tier of government is closest to the people and is the coal face of service delivery. And we know that service delivery is the bedrock of any nation\\'s development. It requires skills, expertise, compassion and adroitness. In South Africa, protests about delivery have been explosive and persistent. Everyone seemed to breathe a sigh of relief that Van Rooyen was removed from the Treasury, but is anyone asking what makes him suitable for the critical co-operative governance and traditional affairs portfolio? I do not know much about him, except what those who have worked with him in Merafong and parliament have had to say. At best they merely acknowledge him. Many can barely remember him. No one has said he is a trailblazer. I am deeply concerned that the ANC and the government seem to be suggesting that if Van Rooyen is not suitable for the Treasury, he will automatically be suitable for local government. Maybe, but dare we experiment at such a critical time? I think not.\n",

      "Spectre of Sparrow saga haunts \\'no-to-racists\\' DA Party leader in KwaZulu-Natal lambasted for statement during \\'monkey\\' storm THE DA\\'s KwaZulu-Natal leader, Zwakele Mncwango, has been hauled over the coals for publicly announcing that Penny Sparrow was a member of the party shortly after her racist Facebook post. The Sunday Times has learnt that DA chief whip John Steenhuisen and chairman Athol Trollip allegedly chastised Mncwango on Friday during the party\\'s federal executive meeting for going public about Sparrow\\'s membership. She was expelled from the DA after writing the post in which she referred to black beachgoers as monkeys. \"[Steenhuisen and Trollip] said Mncwango\\'s admission gave the ANC ammunition ... They said Mncwango could have delayed confirming Sparrow\\'s membership by telling the media he was still verifying the information,\" said a leader who attended the meeting. \"He argued that the DA was a transparent party and protecting her could have led the party to lose its credibility.\" Another source quoted Mncwango as having defended his actions by saying it was in the interests of the party to expose such individuals. \"He became emotional. The DA membership system is electronic; it took him a few minutes to confirm her membership.\" In what could be interpreted as Mncwango venting his frustration after the meeting, he wrote on Facebook: \"It\\'s not usual for me to be angry for more than an hour. I really need some introspection. Anger is not healthy [and has a] psychological effect. All I wish is to be home right now.\" Mncwango refused to comment on the meeting. Steenhuisen denied the allegations saying they were \"completely untrue\". The Mncwango incident came three days after DA leader Mmusi Maimane delivered a speech on race in which he vowed to rid the party of racist elements. The party has been battling accusations of racism - with the ANC using every pretext to throw mud at it. Friday\\'s meeting also decided to launch an all-out campaign to get the party\\'s members and elected representatives to voluntarily sign a pledge against racism, announced by Maimane on Tuesday. At the meeting the party\\'s top leadership rallied behind the pledge, although some reservations were expressed about the exact wording. Maimane has a mountain to climb if he wants the party\\'s MPs and senior staff to become more representative. The DA\\'s MPs and its top staff managers are overwhelmingly white, according to figures obtained this week. The parliamentary caucus is 66% white, 21% black, 8% coloured and 5% Indian. Although an exact racial breakdown of voting patterns is impossible because race is not indicated on the ballot, the DA estimates that its support among black South Africans grew from 0.8% in 2009 to about 6% in 2014, which would mean about 760000 blacks voted for it. The party believes its support among Indians grew from 53.7% in 2009 to 61% in 2014, among coloureds from 55.5% to 67.7% and whites from 83.9% to 92.8%. Maimane said on Tuesday DA structures must set targets for the recruitment and development of candidates for public office. He said it would be done without \"resorting to dehumanising quotas that reduce human beings to statistics\", but did not explain further. Prominent DA members have largely backed his call. His predecessor as DA parliamentary leader, Lindiwe Mazibuko, called the speech an \"outstanding initiative\" in her column in Business Day, but was critical of the how the party dealt with race internally. She referred to \"the almost exclusive dominance of white males within the party\\'s \\'brains trust\\'\". DA MPs who spoke to the Sunday Times largely supported Maimane\\'s call, though some, speaking on condition of anonymity, argued that it could unleash racial \"bean-counting\". Federal council chairman James Selfe said Maimane\\'s requirement had yet to be \"operationalised\" and this would start to happen at the meeting over the weekend. Trollip declined to comment yesterday. shobas@sundaytimes.co.za joubertj@sundaytimes.co.za vanonseleng@sundaytimes.co.za CRUNCHING THE FIGURES: Party leader Mmusi Maimane wants the DA\\'s leadership structures to be reflective of the South African population.

      "ANC backs off from disciplining Pravin pals Party\\'s top structure deadlocks after summoning outspoken leaders to Luthuli House I was about to go when they said the meeting was off A PLAN by President Jacob Zuma and his allies to reprimand pro-Gordhan senior ANC leaders was scuppered when it met serious resistance from three of the party\\'s top six. The Sunday Times can today reveal that Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and his deputy, Joe Phaahla, were among those summoned to appear before the top six on Monday to answer for their public support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. But they were turned back before they reached Luthuli House amid disagreement among the six. Motsoaledi and Phaahla confirmed receiving notices to appear before the leadership. \"I was about to go when they said the meeting was off. I didn\\'t know it was to be disciplined. I was just called to meet officials,\" Motsoaledi told the Sunday Times this week. Phaahla said he did not know why he was called to Luthuli House. \"I would not venture to say what the purpose was because it did not happen. It would be speculative ...\" Insiders said that Zuma, his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, his deputy Jessie Duarte, national chairwoman Baleka Mbete and treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize deadlocked over whether the pro-Gordhan leaders should be hauled over the coals. Motsoaledi and Phaahla were among the senior ANC leaders who supported Gordhan in interviews with the Sunday Times a few days before he was due in court on Wednesday on fraud charges. Other outspoken pro-Gordhan members include Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom, Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi, ANC chief whip in parliament Jackson Mthembu and national executive committee member Enoch Godongwana. Sources said that, after a marathon meeting, the top six officials decided not to proceed with the reprimand session. The meeting, according to the insiders, agreed that individual leaders should express their displeasure about the conduct of the pro-Gordhan group and advise members to raise their views within party structures. Godongwana said he never received an invitation to a meeting with the top officials. \"I did not receive anything that says anybody who expressed support for the finance minister would be reprimanded,\" he said. Motsoaledi came under fire for telling the Sunday Times that state institutions were being used for political ends and that bringing the fraud charge against Gordhan was \"a declaration of war\". He told the Sunday Times this week he stood by his statements. The national prosecuting authority and the Hawks had lost all credibility. \"It was my fear. I was scared of law and order being sacrificed. The next time the NPA says they are charging someone, who will believe them?\" Motsoaledi said he had been concerned that law enforcement agencies would lose their integrity - and that was \"exactly what happened\". Mantashe said the top six decided to call on all ANC leaders to stop making public statements - they did not only call on people who had expressed views against current leaders. \"The issue we are dealing with is, why is it easy for leaders to howl at each other in public?\" They decided that if they called Mthembu, Motsoaledi and Phaahla to order, they would also have to call out Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association leader Kebby Maphatsoe and ANC Youth League president Collen Maine. hunterq@sundaytimes.co.za CREDIBILITY: Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi SPECULATIVE: Deputy Health Minister Joe Phaahla\n",

      "As the government goes rogue, court steps in to save the day SOCIAL Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini should consider herself lucky to have been let off relatively lightly by the Constitutional Court. Sure, she got a spanking from the eminences who described her conduct as incomprehensible and reprehensible. She may yet pay the legal costs from her own pocket. But she escaped a more serious indictment. She could have been had for contempt of court. The saga was not merely a dereliction of duty, it was an open defiance of a judgment by the highest court. It\\'s almost as if she regards herself as being above the law. She could, and should, have been dragged in front of the court to explain her conduct. One could see even as judgment was passed that the justices have been left befuddled by her behaviour. Only she could have enlightened them. She could also have been rapped over the knuckles for her failure to meet Tuesday\\'s deadline to answer questions sent by the court. Asked why the deadline was not met, her lawyer said something to the effect of: \"Well these things happen. We\\'ll ask for the court\\'s condonation.\" One can almost sense the court\\'s reluctance to involve itself in a fight with the government. But it is being dragged into one by the wilful incompetence of President Jacob Zuma and his administration. The conditions of the judgment mean the Constitutional Court will be babysitting a government department. That\\'s an indictment. It means the court cannot trust the government to do the right thing. But don\\'t expect Zuma or Dlamini to feel embarrassed. They\\'re shameless. In fact, the government\\'s delinquent behaviour is sucking the judiciary more and more into the political arena. As the Constitutional Court was handing down its judgment on Friday, the High Court in Pretoria was declaring the appointment of Berning Ntlemeza, head of the Hawks, invalid; and the Prasa board was contesting its summary dismissal by Transport Minister Dipuo Peters. These are actions of a government that has gone rogue. It\\'s left to the judiciary to preserve our sanity. The grants matter should not have been allowed to come to this point. The penetrating questions posed by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to Dlamini\\'s legal representative this week should have been the sort of inquiry that she should have been subjected to by Zuma and his cabinet. Why was this tender so shoddily handled and why had nothing been done in two years to remedy the situation? Dlamini should have been hauled over the coals, or fired, after the Constitutional Court\\'s judgment declaring the Cash Paymaster Services contract invalid. Zuma neither asked such questions nor acted against her. He turned out to be Dlamini\\'s chief apologist, pleading with the country to calm down. Maybe Dlamini is not the kingpin in this matter, but a mere courier. The buck stops with Zuma. The involvement of his trusted lieutenants - South African Revenue Service commissioner Tom Moyane and Michael Hulley, his trusted attorney - in awarding the contract to CPS, means Zuma may not be a disinterested bystander. There is a lot that still needs to be revealed. For instance why CPS, lacking BEE credentials, was able to win such a lucrative government contract. It seems proponents of radical economic transformation were asleep at the switch. Payment of social grants is a huge state responsibility - second only to the economy and safety and security - especially given the extent of poverty and destitution in the country. Recipients also happen to be a loyal ANC constituency, often referred to as \"our people\". It\\'s surprising therefore to see an ANC government handling an issue of life and death for its constituency with such disdain and ham-handedness. Ironically, it was the Black Sash, an organisation often dismissed in ANC circles as a bunch of liberals, that came to the rescue - defending the rights of mainly poor black recipients against the incompetence and dereliction of duty by a black government. ANC members who turned up in court were not there to express common cause with the poor, but to support Dlamini, the villain of the piece. Others were at the airport to welcome Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma back from Addis Ababa where her campaign to be president of South Africa has been headquartered for the past four years. It\\'s as if she\\'s never been away from home. Dlamini-Zuma is no stranger to scandal, having been involved in the Sarafina debacle in the first ANC government. Corruption, it seems, is a prerequisite for higher office. Zuma\\'s record is well known. Dlamini is a convicted fraudster, found guilty in the Travelgate saga. That wasn\\'t a bar to promotion. She\\'s now in charge of a department with a budget worth billions - and she\\'s making a mighty hash of things. Thanks to the Constitutional Court, the old, the sick and infirm will receive their pitiful handouts. But one is left with a feeling that the miscreants have almost got off scot-free.\n",

      "Cops have not learnt Wits killing highlights urgency of public order police training Policing experts and unions are sounding the alarm over the apparent failure of South African Police Service (SAPS) management to properly implement the Marikana commission of inquiry\\'s recommendations to train officers in dealing with public violence. CCTV footage shows public order police indiscriminately firing at close range into crowds of protesting Wits University students in Johannesburg this week. A bystander, Mthokozisi Ntumba, was killed in the gunfire, and several students were wounded. Police minister Bheki Cele has also been sharply criticised for sitting on a report by international and national experts which provides strategic guidance on how to deal with various policing challenges. Both the SAPS and Cele\\'s office have dismissed the accusations. Marikana commission chair judge Ian Farlam called for the establishment of the panel of experts, which gave its report to Cele in 2018. The panel\\'s deputy chair, Eldred de Klerk, said Cele had sat on their report and its recommendations for two years. \"The report was to give the police ministry strategic direction to transform and professionalise the SAPS,\" said De Klerk. \"Even though SAPS were part of the panel, there seems to be very little institutional movement or commitment to learn from Marikana or other fatal protest shootings with a lack of policy and strategic direction.\" De Klerk said the police portfolio committee needed to be hauled over the coals for not demanding the report\\'s release. He added that as long as transformation and implementation of strategies did not happen there would be future Ntumba killings. Sean Tait, African Policing Civilian Oversight Forum director, said there were cracks in the SAPS public order policing system. \"There is hardly any coherence. Policies and instructions are not filtering down to officers on the ground. What happened in Braamfontein demonstrates this. None of the critical lessons from the 2016 Fees Must Fall protests on how to deal with demonstrations have been passed on to members.\" Tait said rubber bullets could be lethal. \"Firing rubber bullets must be based on the principles of necessity, proportionality and on precaution. These principles were violated this week. \"Within Gauteng, and in particular Johannesburg, public order policing members have not got the message, unlike those in the Free State, who, during the 2020 Senekal protests, demonstrated restraint in a highly volatile situation. In Gauteng, this unit\\'s members, like those in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Limpopo, have a cavalier recklessness in firing rubber bullets.\" Tait said urgent training of police in the appropriate use of firearms in protests was needed. \"Indiscriminate firing is never allowed. If you are looking at dispersal, rubber bullets can only be fired if there is an imminent threat against life or property.\" He said when firing rubber bullets, policies dictated the \"skip round\" principal must be followed where rounds are fired into the ground first and not directly at a person. \"You cannot also fire a rubber bullet from close range. Given that rubber bullets can kill, there must be substantial distance between protesters and police.\" Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union spokesperson Richard Mamabola said while police management had committed to implementing the Marikana commission recommendations, getting them \"implemented so people are protected and our members are not left vulnerable to breaching the law is a major challenge\". He said that despite the police saying training, especially that of public order units, would be prioritised, it had not been, \"with refresher courses seldom occurring\". Cele\\'s spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, said the panel of experts report would be released at the end of March. \"It is not public because there were technicalities from the team dealing with the report that had to be addressed,\" he said. Police spokesperson Col Brenda Muridili said that following the Marikana commission\\'s recommendations, the SAPS crowd management learning programme was revised in 2016. \"A crowd conflict management course is in the early stages of being rolled out,\" she said. \"All public order policing training material has been revised. Platoon commanders are trained in commanding and managing their personnel and crowd management situations.\" Asked how often refresher training was done, Muridili said on an \"ad hoc\" basis. She said should any member exceed the boundaries of the law, in any situation, they would be required to account for their actions both criminally and departmentally. Former SAPS ballistics expert Wollie Wolmeraans said investigations involving rubber bullets were extremely difficult. \"Shotgun barrels, unless defective, do not leave markings, especially not on rubber bullets. To prove which gun and policeman fired the fatal round in the Ntumba case will be difficult, especially if the cartridge cannot be found.\" He said the investigation would come down to CCTV and cellphone footage, witness statements and an expert reconstruction of the crime scene. \"There must be a very careful crime scene reconstruction. For that to happen there is an urgency to secure every second of available CCTV footage and for this to be analysed in detail.\" He said for someone to die from a rubber bullet, the shooter had to be very close. Police and Wits students face off in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, on Wednesday during protests over university fees. A bystander, Mthokozisi Ntumba, was shot dead when police fired rubber bullets at close range at demonstrators. Picture: Alon Skuy\n",

      "A test for democracy, and for Cyril and John It is hard to believe that there was a time in SA when local government elections were not considered as significant as they are these days. The run-up to the polls would be low key compared with what happened when national and provincial elections were held. The turnout would also be much lower, and this was often read as indication that the electorate wasn\\'t as inspired by local candidates as they were by national political figures. Yet local government was, and continues to be, at the coal face of service delivery. A municipality\\'s performance, or lack thereof, directly affects the lives of citizens living within its boundaries. Now, even though significantly fewer people still turn out for municipal elections than they do for national and provincial ones, the picture has changed. There has been more public focus on the state of our municipalities during the current campaign season than we have seen before. Anecdotal evidence suggests that voters are paying closer attention to who the candidates are in their wards than they did in the past, which partly explains the increase in the number of people running as independents. Pity, however, that in most areas, political parties did not create platforms where their candidates could present their plans for their wards and have those interrogated by the communities they seek to represent. This would have enhanced the quality of the process. But as much as these elections are primarily about bread-and-butter issues at municipality and ward levels, we cannot escape that they are also a referendum on the performances of political parties, various tiers of government and individual national leaders. In this edition of the Sunday Times, for instance, ANC national executive committee member and veteran communicator Nkenke Kekana opens his opinion piece on the elections by admitting that \"corruption is pervasive in the government\", that \"in several instances our comrades are not distinguishable from criminals\", and that a \"lack of ethics has tainted the credibility\" of the governing party. He does so out of recognition that when millions of citizens cast their votes tomorrow, on their minds will not just be whether their local authorities are able to provide basic services such as running water, electricity and tarred roads. With their Xs, voters will also be expressing their views on the government\\'s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the personal protective equipment corruption scandals, Eskom\\'s inability to guarantee power and many other issues that have exercised the minds of the public since the country last went to the polls, in 2019. Much of the attention in the days immediately after tomorrow\\'s voting will turn to the horse- trading in a number of metros that are likely to once again have hung councils. But in the not so distant future, the overall results will be revisited - and used as a performance scorecard for at least two of the country\\'s national leaders. John Steenhuisen rose to become the leader of the official opposition on the back of the DA\\'s less than impressive performance in the 2019 general elections. How the party does at the polls tomorrow will be seen as DA voters\\' comment on how he has fared in office since taking over from Mmusi Maimane. If the party fails to arrest the vote-bleeding that started in 2019, he may not be around in 2024 to lead the party\\'s campaign in the general election. Equally in the spotlight is President Cyril Ramaphosa. Let\\'s exclude, for a moment, the allegations that millions of rands pumped into his campaign essentially bought him victory at Nasrec in 2017; Ramaphosa largely owes his ascent to the ANC presidency to the party\\'s poor showing at the 2016 local government elections under then president Jacob Zuma. Those results, when the party lost a couple of metros, so spooked many of its leaders that they turned on Zuma and started looking for a leader who would help them avoid dipping below 50%. He delivered in 2019 and some pundits even credit him with the party\\'s success in winning an outright, but slim, majority in Gauteng when most expected it to fall short. But has he done enough since the 2019 elections to help his party secure outright victories in Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni - metros that slipped out of the party\\'s hands amid claims that voters were put off by Zuma? Ramaphosa and Steenhuisen were upbeat at the end of their campaigns yesterday, with the president even telling this newspaper that his party \"will surprise many people who thought the ANC was on its knees\". However, it is out of their hands now. It is time for the electorate to give its verdict. People from the settlement of Boikhutso collect water from a tanker in Lichtenburg. Poor service delivery has made local governance an ever more urgent issue in SA.Alaister Russell\n",

      "Hogarth A lawyer joke all by himself With the president displaying reluctance to govern by outsourcing his prerogative to nominate the next chief justice, it was left to a few lawyers, judges and politicians on the Judicial Service Commission to assess the suitability of the four shortlisted candidates. However, instead of finding out if the jurists have what it takes to occupy this important seat, some of the commissioners turned the proceedings into a circus. At one point, EFF lawyer Dali Mpofu made a bizarre attempt at comedy, joking about having \"spent a night\" with chief justice aspirant and president of the Supreme Court of Appeal Mandisa Maya. The comment left everyone shocked before the tactless Mpofu clarified what he meant: he and Maya had studied through the night while in pupillage to become members of the bar. As if Maya hadn\\'t faced enough patriarchal probing from the commissioners already. Not funny at all, Dali. Male president for life The commissioners were obsessed with the most ridiculous and irrelevant questions. One of their favourites was asking the candidates whether SA is ready for a female chief justice - a question judge Maya correctly found extremely annoying. The same question was directed at the first candidate to be interviewed on Tuesday, Constitutional Court justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga. Leader of the red berets Julius Malema went further, asking Madlanga why he had availed himself for the post if he believed it was time for a woman to take over the top judicial job. This led to an exchange in which an annoyed Madlanga asked if Juju would make way in the EFF for a female leader. \"If the EFF nominates me to be its president for the third, for the fourth and even the fifth time I will be available until I go to retirement if they want me,\" Juju responded. Why are we not surprised? Kiddie Amin the dictator. New face, same tactics The posture adopted by Mpofu and Malema at the hearings was not surprising given they are prone to childish political games and attending tea parties in Nkandla. But they had a fellow traveller in advocate Griffiths Madonsela - the lawyer who famously read the late King Goodwill Zwelithini\\'s disputed will at a chaotic royal family meeting. Madonsela grilled Gauteng judge president Dunstan Mlambo about court judgments that were not in favour of the Nkandla Crooner and his army of supporters, and asked if he was part of Ramaphosa\\'s support club. If the hearings hadn\\'t been televised, Old Hog could have easily mistaken Madonsela for Not-Jimmy Manyi or his terrible twin, Carl Niehaus. An RET sort of chap After suffering yet another setback when the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed his attempt to return to office at Luthuli House, Ace Magashule made a public appearance in Soweto at the home of party veteran Tokyo Sexwale, who has lost his mother. Magashule took advantage of the press mob to motivate his radical economic transformation forces by cheering on Mervyn Dirks - the suspended ANC MP who wants parliament to haul Ramaphosa over the coals for a recorded audio clip in which McBuffalo insinuates that public money was used to fund ANC campaigns. Magashule sang Dirks\\'s praises, saying he did the right thing by reporting his boss to the parliamentary watchdog. \"That chap is principled. I love chaps like him,\" he said. Of course you do, we all know where Dirks takes his orders from. Virtually invisible Our MPs are still struggling to adapt to the new normal of virtual meetings. Remember when they used to place laptops and iPads so close to their faces that only their chins were visible when they talked? Well, it seems some have yet to familiarise themselves with all of Zoom\\'s functions. One of Hogarth\\'s colleagues attended a committee meeting that took half a day. After five hours, an MP told the committee chair that his hand had been up but he had been ignored. It turns out that instead of clicking the \"hand up\" button, the poor MP had literally raised his hand at home in his study - and wondered why the chair wasn\\'t noticing him.

      "For the ANC, it\\'s \\'our friends, right or wrong\\', and changing that mantra means losing face BARNEYMTHOMBOTHI At a function in Pretoria this week to celebrate Poland\\'s national day, social development minister Lindiwe Zulu, representing the government, spoke about everything under the sun except the elephant in the room - the war in Ukraine. She merely referred to it in passing simply because, before her, the Polish ambassador had spoken about it in caustic terms. Instead, Zulu, who arrived almost an hour late, spoke glowingly about the black children from an orphanage in Johannesburg who danced and performed songs in Polish, and the value of learning a second language. She told her esteemed audience she had spent six years in the Soviet Union, where she had done all her studies in Russian. Oh, and Miss SA Lalela Mswane was gracing the occasion. \"How could I have forgotten about you!\" Zulu exclaimed as she returned to the podium to wish her luck for her participation in a beauty contest which, incidentally, will be held in Poland. The bloodshed in Ukraine, far from our shores, remains an unwelcome distraction for the government. Poland\\'s ambassador, Andrzej Kanthak, whose country borders Ukraine, had no such qualms. He was undiplomatically scathing of Russia\\'s aggression, calling it a disaster not only for Ukraine, but for Europe; and a startling breach of international law. Poland is home to more than half of the estimated 6-million Ukrainians who\\'ve fled their country. \"Poles have opened their homes and their hearts,\" he said. \"The scale and intensity of this disaster go far beyond normal categories of diplomatic analysis. Nothing like this has happened in our lifetimes - the destruction of towns and cities, war crimes, crimes against humanity.\" Zulu, who heads the ANC\\'s international relations subcommittee, alluded to the invasion as \"the difficulties you\\'ve referred to\" and promptly moved on to more important matters. She had previously said she won\\'t criticise President Vladimir Putin\\'s invasion of Ukraine because she had spent the better part of her time in exile in the Soviet Union. That\\'s probably the nub of the problem as far as our foreign policy is concerned: it\\'s guided more by favours granted to some of our leaders when they were in desperate need in exile than by the country\\'s principles or interests. Who stood with us, rather than what we stand for. The ANC obviously doesn\\'t subscribe to Lord Palmerston\\'s oft-quoted injunction that a country does not have friends or enemies, only interests. For the ANC, it\\'s \"our friends, right or wrong\". How the government has dealt with the bloodshed in Ukraine has become an ugly monkey on its back and is doing enormous damage to the country\\'s international standing. But things needn\\'t have turned out this way. The government, in a way, prepared the rod for its own back. It\\'s the infighting in the government and the ruling party over the issue that has led to such confusion and embarrassment. Had the initial statement by Naledi Pandor\\'s department of international relations & co-operation criticising the invasion been allowed to stand, we\\'d probably have moved on and kept a distant interest in the matter. Instead, President Cyril Ramaphosa hauled Pandor over the coals for daring to release such a denunciation of the invasion. Ramaphosa has never shown any enthusiasm to discipline ministers such as Lindiwe Sisulu who have brazenly got out of line. But this time, probably to humour Putin, he let Pandor know of his displeasure in no uncertain terms. And the ANC, led by the likes of Zulu, piled it on. Pandor had to eat her words. Ramaphosa, in a phone call to Putin, other than expressing his undying support, also offered to mediate in the conflict. Our hubris knows no bounds, it seems. And when, in a statement which seemed almost as though drafted by the Russian embassy in Pretoria, Ramaphosa profusely thanked Putin for taking his call, his poodledom was assured. Ukraine\\'s Volodymyr Zelensky had understandably kept his distance from Ramaphosa; and when the two finally spoke, there was obviously no meeting of minds. Almost as if to take advantage of the government\\'s discomfort, DA leader John Steenhuisen spent the past week touring war zones in Ukraine, posing in front of destroyed tanks and gaping, soulless buildings and then posting them on social media - more like a tourist sending postcards back home to let them know what he\\'s been up to. And he got plenty of stick for the visit. \"What about the war on the Cape Flats? one wag inquired. \"Hope you visit Syria on your way back!\" intoned another. I\\'m sure he won\\'t mind the pasting. It simply helps to publicise his visit. And most of his critics don\\'t and won\\'t vote for him anyway. But criticising a politician for taking advantage of a situation or capitalising on his foe\\'s woes is like criticising a dog for peeing against a tree. Steenhuisen is doing what politicians normally do - exploiting an enemy\\'s soft underbelly. He\\'s there because the government is confused and befuddled on the issue, and therefore missing in action. He\\'s exploiting the void, making sure every word he utters, every photo, is all over social media. Americans often say that partisan politics should end at the water\\'s edge. In other words, politicians of all stripes desist from criticising their government or its policies while outside the country. We don\\'t have such a tradition. It\\'s a free-for-all. Those hoping that the unspeakable crimes being committed in Ukraine, the rising food prices here at home as a result, or basic self-interest will ultimately wean Ramaphosa or his party from Putin will be disappointed. The leash is too resilient. Besides, the government will simply dig in for fear of losing face.

      "SECRET UMLAZI RECIPE WINS 2022 BOERIE CHAMPIONSHIP The 30th anniversary of the annual Shoprite/Checkers Championship Boerewors competition was held in Cape Town last Saturday. was there to witness the 10 finalists battling it out for the title SA\\'s favourite sausage has suffered many incarnations, some good, some bad, but in seeking an original, the country comes to the fore. This was reflected in the more than 2,000 people who entered their recipes to the annual Shoprite/Checkers Championship Boerewors competition. This year marked the 30th anniversary of the popular event and I was there last Saturday to witness 10 nervous but excited finalists as they lined up for a grilling at Cabo Beach near the Waterfront in Cape Town. They hailed from around the country and included a good mix of butchers, two full-time students, one of whom took top honours in 2020, and two women, Nikita de Lange, 24, a trainer from Alberton, and Phozisa Magoda, 29, a butchery manager in Fisantekraal in the Western Cape. The nationwide search for 2022\\'s finest boerewors recipe kicked off in May, when the supermarket group partnered with South African Chefs Association (Saca) culinary experts entrusted with ensuring all entries were authentic and adhered to the guidelines for making truly traditional boerewors. LOOKING FOR THE BEST BOERIE RECIPE Boerewors is the only recipe whose ingredients are stipulated in the Government Gazette and, timeously, updated regulations were announced last week. According to the competition rules that follow these regulations, the organisers were looking for the best recipe made according to these guidelines: Traditional boerewors must contain at least 90% meat - the main component must be beef, as well as lamb or pork (or a mixture of both), and the fat content may not exceed 30%. The distinctive combinations of spices such as coriander, cloves, nutmeg and black pepper, as well as liquids such as vinegar, water and Worcestershire sauce are what differentiates boerewors from other variants. The recipe may not contain bacon, chutney, cheese, peri-peri, curry, tomato sauce, peppadews, green pepper, Parmesan, Aromat, chilli, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, paprika, whole peppercorns, green and pink peppercorns, lemon, soy, mustard, kidney (offal) fat, alcohol or venison. HOW THE COMPETITION WORKS The competition started in 1992 as an internal event for Shoprite/Checkers employees. In 2001 it was decided that in seeking out the country\\'s best boerewors recipe, the contest needed to be opened to everyone. Saca\\'s honorary past president and vice-president of the World Association of Chefs, chef Martin Kobald, has judged the competition for 18 years and, explaining the format, said it starts with Saca chefs going through the recipes submitted, the paper round, which must be original and adhere to the regulations. From this round 100 entries are selected, which are then whittled down to 30. In the next round the chefs and Shoprite/Checkers butchery experts make up the 30 recipes - raw and cooked. These are tasted and 10 finalists chosen. They then make up their recipes in the presence of a Saca representative and, if they pass the test, go to the finals. They then sign a declaration that their recipe remains a secret and head to the final cook-off. On the day of the competition there\\'s much fanfare and excitement as a large crowd comes together - the finalists\\' families, selected customers, staff and media gather at the \"beach\" for a celebratory braai-off with entertainment, music and, of course, many boerie rolls. Each finalist is assisted by a Saca chef (this, according to the organisers, helps allay the entrants\\' nerves) and together they cook their boerewors over the coals to the finalist\\'s specifications. Once cooked it is presented, alongside the raw version, to the judges, who taste and rate the boerewors. Once they\\'ve tasted all the recipes the scores are collated and verified by auditors and the winner is announced. Celebrity chef and Checkers brand ambassador Zola Nene, who has judged the competition for five years, said: \"The tasting process is quite rigorous - we taste the boerewors raw and cooked to make sure the flavours are balanced and delicious in both stages. The standard of entries is always very high. Entrants take the competition very seriously and whenever the judging becomes difficult, that\\'s when we know we have found quality - and a worthy winner.\" MEET THE WINNER An overjoyed Welcome Magoso, 23, from Umlazi, south of Durban, couldn\\'t believe his luck when his name was called out as the winner of the 2022 Championship Boerewors competition. \"I\\'m so happy about what happened today,\" he said minutes after taking the title. Magoso, a first-time entrant, is a meat technician at Shoprite in Umlazi. \"When sitting with my recipe before I came here [to Cape Town] they [my colleagues] told me I was number one, but I wasn\\'t sure ... and was very nervous,\" he said. It was his brother, who accompanied him to Cape Town, who helped secure his job. \"My brother works at Checkers. After leaving school I couldn\\'t find a job and when the opportunity came up to train as a blockman, he put my name forward,\" said Magoso. After in-store training, it took five months of making boerewors with his colleagues and analysing each of his endeavours before he believed he\\'d found the right recipe to submit to the competition. His winning entry was for a thick boerewors (competitors can enter thick or thin wors recipes). The secret, he said, was to use quality, A-grade meat. He combined beef and pork \"which makes the boerewors very juicy. You must have the juiciness,\" he emphasised. More than that he\\'s not giving anything away - as per the rules of the competition he can\\'t disclose his recipe. With a huge smile, Magoso said winning meant a lot, and it would change his life. With the R50,000 prize money he was going to build a house and with his prize car, a bright red Toyota Fortuner worth more than R600,000, he could now drive to work. This would make life much easier for him, his parents and four siblings. Apart from the prizes, the top honour is having his boerewors sold in Shoprite and Checkers nationwide from September 9. The runners-up, Chris Roodt, a meat market manager from Cradock in the Eastern Cape, and student Delano Jasper, a previous winner, won R30,000 and R20,000 respectively. MEET THE FIRST WINNER In 1992 Tommy Hendriks, above, walked off with a R6,000 prize. Now retired, he was then a butcher at Shoprite in Upington. Hendriks believes it was his training as a blockman and polony/sausage maker that stood him in good stead. He said the best boerewors is made using top-quality, well-trimmed beef brisket. And cooking? If cooked over a fire, he said Namibian kameelhout makes the best coals. If cooked in a pan it is best to warm it first. And, he warned, never use a fork to turn boerewors. Instead, use an egg lifter. More than 2,000 people entered this year\\'s Shoprite/Checkers Championship Boerewors competition.123rf/waldrago Tommy Hendriks, the competition\\'s first winner.Supplied Jubilant 2022 winner Welcome Magoso from Umlazi, south of Durban.Supplied A tough task for the judges.Supplied Jubilant 2022 winner Welcome Magoso from Umlazi, south of Durban.Supplied\n",

      "We can\\'t leave the fight against corruption to the government Civil society needs to carve out a role as an active partner, making our democracy participatory At the 54th conference of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa was elected president by the narrowest of margins - he obtained 51.9% of the vote. The Zondo commission has shown beyond doubt that South Africa was trapped in corruption so widespread that we have to ask ourselves what led to it becoming systemic. We know that a host of institutions that make up our democracy were hollowed out so that the looting and plunder of our country\\'s resources could take place with impunity. One shudders to think where our country would be if Ramaphosa had not been elected. Despite the fact that we as a country have made significant progress in changing the lives of our people, we face the danger that unless we immediately take the right actions we may wipe out that progress. In our debates and discussions about what to do we are long on diagnoses and short on immediate and practical steps. Reaching the vision set out in the Freedom Charter and marshalling the country out of its current plight demands that we focus on the immediate measures we have to implement. If we don\\'t do so, then disarray and disillusionment with democracy will grow. On the immediate agenda three issues stand out. The campaign to weed out corruption must be unrelenting and gather momentum. The steps being taken to repair the damage wrought on the entire chain of the criminal justice system are beginning to bear results. We are only beginning to stem the tide of corruption. But it is critical that this campaign must grow into a national effort. Second, we must disentangle service delivery from corruption and incompetence. Unless we do so at the local and municipal level we shall give no cause for people to have faith in the future. Third, we must take steps to ensure that this is done in ways that make citizens participants. The media and civil society played, and continue to play, a critical role in exposing corruption and enforcing accountability. Armed now with the Zondo report, we cannot leave the task in the government\\'s hands alone. Zondo recommends that \"the government give consideration to the creation of a statutory offence rendering it a criminal offence for any person vested with public power to abuse [that] power ... by using [it] otherwise than in good faith for a proper purpose\". He suggests this crime should carry a maximum penalty of a R200m fine or 20 years in prison or both. Nothing prevents a civil society organisation from drafting the necessary legislation and lobbying the leaders of political parties to table and promote it in parliament, if necessary as a private member\\'s bill. Let each party be canvassed, and let those who are unwilling stand exposed for paying lip-service to fighting corruption. Why has no-one undertaken this task already? Zondo\\'s proposal was made public 10 months ago, and there is no draft in sight. Another example: it is common practice for employees to resign before disciplinary proceedings commence. Zondo informs us that there is no legal recourse available to address this issue. Is this not a matter that could be addressed through the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac)? None of the sectors are precluded from bringing a matter of national interest to Nedlac, where the government, business, labour and civil society are represented. Surely the unions have an interest in and are best placed to play a significant role in preventing people from getting away with wrongdoing by resigning before disciplinary proceedings commence. It is common cause that local government is the coal face for the delivery of services. The auditor-general\\'s reports have long pointed to the dismal state of municipal and district councils. Communities despair of the delivery of basic services. Is this not the place where we should be initiating and implementing measures, where participatory democracy should be rooted? Our legislation provides for establishing ward committees. Despite our desire to create a people-centred and participatory democracy, little has been done to make ward councillors engage in the ward committees in ways that involve the communities. It should be a forum where communities have a say in what services should be prioritised for their area, as well as monitoring and giving feedback on whether funds allocated for their area have been properly used. This again is an area relating to the building of our democracy that cannot be left solely to the elected councillors. Civil society needs to carve out a role as an active partner, making our democracy participatory. While I raise these issues as challenges to civil society, I am mindful of the centrality of the ANC putting its house in order. We need to remind ourselves that we learn more from our mistakes than from our achievements. The obstacle to learning from our mistakes arises because attempts to interrogate the experience of 28 years of building our democracy become enmeshed in playing the blame game. We cannot resist using mistakes - be they acts of omission or commission - to score points in inter-party rivalry and intraparty jostling for access to opportunity and power. Our constitution is founded on the understanding that the tension between the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and the chapter 9 institutions is what makes our democracy dynamic. Included in this dynamism is the tension between these state organs and the media and civil society. This tension provides the guardrails against power and patronage trampling on the fundamental rights of citizens. The ANC engages in propaganda because its purpose is to justify, explain and enlist the support of the public. Walter Sisulu, under whose tenure as secretary-general the ANC became mass-based, always found it necessary to explain that in carrying out our work we must never mislead the people, never tell them lies, and never cause division. Regrettably these precepts seem to be forgotten by so many involved in the factionalism and jostling for access to opportunity, patronage and power. For such people, self-interest trumps national interest. Lessons learnt in the process of becoming a mass party have helped us to steer a path during many crises we faced. We succeeded because we stayed true to Sisulu\\'s message. The democracy we fashioned is intended to liberate the citizenry, to ensure that they have a platform from which they can better continue the journey to freedom, a journey that we share with all humankind. We find ourselves today filled with anxiety, anguish and anger at the machinations that invade the ANC\\'s efforts at renewal. Our anxiety is heightened because no other political formation in our country bears even the faintest promise to realise the vision in the covenant we made in 1955, the Freedom Charter. If we resolutely pursue the campaign against corruption, if we find ways to ensure service delivery happens, and if we ensure that our defence of democracy embraces the necessity to make it people-centred and participatory, we shall have set our compass right for the country. Setting our country on the right path is a necessary condition for the ANC to renew itself. Maharaj is a former ANC leader.

Here are some tips and recipes to ease the cooking burden when the electricity is out, writes LORRAINE MAHARAJ Food blogger and recipe developer Lorraine Maharaj\\'s speciality is easy home cooking - with a dash of spice. She lives in Johannesburg with her husband and two sons, who have big appetites for her delicious recipes. #tamarindnthyme LOAD-SHEDDING TIPS: • Plan, plan, plan. Download the Eskom app and take note of load-shedding times. A gas cooker is a bonus. • Stock up on canned goods such as beans, pilchards, tuna. They\\'re not always what we want to eat, but there are loads of salads, dips and sandwiches we can make using them. • Double up on dishes and freeze when there is power; this will be your lifesaver in dark times. Think of meals that don\\'t need freezing, but can be refrigerated for a couple of days. • Curries and pastas make great dishes for bulk cooking. They are easy to reheat and if you\\'re tired of cold meals, they are great comfort foods. • I keep a selection of dried herbs and spices which can easily turn an ordinary meal into a tasty treat. I love chilli, but if you\\'d like to use less, reduce the quantity, which won\\'t compromise the flavour. • A shop-bought or home-roasted chicken is so versatile and can be the base of many meals, such as chicken pasta, a main-course chicken salad, chicken mayo sandwiches, chicken wraps and soup on cold days. • Cheese and charcuterie boards are also great ideas. There are loads of dips that can be made and there are amazing store-bought ones too. • Growing up, we loved it when my mum cooked a curry on a fire outside. Why not rekindle old memories. Get the family together at weekends and cook a meal on a fire or braai. TIN-FISH CURRY SERVES 4-6 A delicious, quick and affordable curry made with canned pilchards or middle cut. 75ml (5 tbsp) vegetable oil 2 onions, chopped 2 sprigs curry leaves 4 green chillies, slit in half, optional 6 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed 30ml (2 tbsp) masala 10ml (2 tsp) chilli powder, use less or more as desired 5ml (1 tsp) turmeric 5ml (1 tsp) ground cumin 8 Roma tomatoes to make about 500ml (2 cups) when grated 30ml (2 tbsp) fresh mint, chopped Salt and pinch of sugar 2 x 425g pilchards in tomato sauce or middle cut Fresh coriander to garnish To serve: 4 hard boiled eggs, optional Rice 1 Heat the oil in a pan, add the onion and curry leaves and sauté until the onion is translucent.

Add the tomatoes and chopped mint. Season with salt and sugar. 3 Drain the liquid from the fish and add it to the pan. Add the fish - I prefer to clean the black bits and remove the bones, but you can add the fish whole if you prefer - and bring to a simmer. Don\\'t stir as the fish will break up. Cook for 10 minutes until fish is heated through. 4 Garnish and serve. If you like, you can add hard-boiled eggs, halved, to the top. 5 Serve over rice.

Try to double up on cooking and refrigerate or freeze meals. • My air fryer has been my power-outage saviour. Working around the load-shedding schedule, I can prepare a variety of meals in less time than in the oven and warm them up on a gas stove in minutes. • A selection of canned foods will always save a dark night. * Don\\'t forget about South Africa\\'s favourite way of cooking - over the coals. I picked up my braai skills while assisting in my father\\'s butchery during the school holidays. Serve the meat/chicken cooked on the braai with a salad or leftover vegetables. CHILLI SAVOURY MINCE SERVES 6 Mince is so versatile and can be used in many ways. This is one of my great standbys to cook on gas during load-shedding. We enjoy this dish served over pap or rice, and as a filling for amagwinya/vetkoek. 60ml (¼ cup) olive or canola oil 1 onion, chopped 3 fresh green chillies, finely chopped, use less if desired or leave out 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped ¼ each large red, yellow and green pepper, pith removed and chopped 500g lean beef mince 15ml (1 tbsp) dried garlic flakes 15ml (1 tbsp) medium curry powder 15ml (1 tbsp) paprika 15ml (1 tbsp) dried oregano 15ml (1 tbsp) tomato paste 15ml (1 tbsp) sweet chilli sauce Salt and pepper to taste 15ml (1 tbsp) all purpose flour 100ml water 1 In a large pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, chillies if using, garlic and peppers. Sauté for 5-6 minutes or until the onion is translucent. Stir in the beef mince. 2 Stir in the garlic flakes, curry powder, paprika, oregano, tomato paste and sweet chilli sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and cook for 3-4 minutes. 3 Lower the heat, slowly stir in the flour and water. Cover with a lid and simmer for10-15 minutes or until the mince is brown and cooked through.

I always have beans, tuna and chickpeas that are ready when you need them and don\\'t need heat to prepare. • Pre-planning goes a long way. Be mindful of the load-shedding schedule and download the app as this will help to plan meals around power. • Braai and gas cooking will be a lifesaver, so invest in portable cookers so you have backup. • Making a fire is another solution and a great way to improve the mood - get everyone around the fire on a dark night. Load-shedding is when I learnt how to make a fire. GINGER & PINEAPPLE LAMB CHOPS SERVES 4-6 This is my great standby recipe, easily prepared on gas or over the coals. Spice rub: 15ml (1 tbsp) paprika 15ml (1 tbsp) steak and chops spice 5ml (1 tsp) black pepper 6-8 lamb chops - you can also use pork chops Pineapple salsa: 250ml (1 cup) canned pineapple rings, chopped (save juice for salsa) 250ml (1 cup) cucumber, chopped 1 red onion, chopped Salt and pepper A handful of coriander, finely chopped Glaze: 125ml (½ cup) pineapple juice saved from canned pineapple 5ml (1 tsp) chopped garlic 5ml (1 tsp) grated ginger 30ml (2 tbsp) soy sauce 15ml (1 tbsp) runny honey 1 Combine the ingredients for the spice rub and rub generously onto the lamb chops.

      "DANCING THE DREAM From District Six to London\\'s Royal Ballet, world-famous ballet dancer Johaar Mosaval talks to Here he is, neat as a pin, his tiny and compact figure seems, even at 95, to be full of an energy that wants to be released as he moves his arms in balletic arcs. The almond-shaped planes of his face reveal a determination and discipline that led him to become a principal dancer at London\\'s Royal Ballet, working at the coal face of one of the hardest jobs in the world. \"I was one of 10 children. Of course, my parents, devout Muslims, were against my becoming a ballet dancer. It was during the days of apartheid and they knew nothing about ballet, added to which I was a boy,\" says Johaar Mosaval. He finally made it to the University of Cape Town (UCT) Ballet Company under Dulcie Howes, \"but I always had to be in the back row\", he says. \"I was the only boy in the class. This was during the days of apartheid and coloured boys did not become ballet dancers.\" Soon enough, people in the dancing world began to notice him. In his early 20s, he met Britain\\'s Alicia Markova, who was touring South Africa. She immediately recognised his talent and an audition was organised. Mosaval achieved top honours, ensuring him a position with Sadler\\'s Wells, a forerunner of the Royal Ballet company. Here he soon became a principal dancer, sharing the international stage with such dance icons as Britain\\'s Margot Fonteyn and Beryl Gray, and South Africa\\'s Nadia Nerina. But Mosaval always knew he had to work harder than any of the others, spurred on perhaps by Howes, who told him he would never get work in London because he was too short. \"When the others went off at tea time for a snack, I would practise. I would even practise on a Sunday and on an aeroplane,\" he laughs. Mosaval became revered for his wide-ranging styles and fluent technique, and for roles such as Jasper in Pineapple Pol and the little clown in The Lady and the Fool. At that time there were many South Africans in the Sadler\\'s Wells ballet company, particularly choreographers, and Mosaval worked with the famous John Cranko and Terence MacMillan, who he danced with for many years. \"The highlight of my career was during Queen Elizabeth II\\'s coronation celebration, which was attended by royalty and then prime minister Winston Churchill. During the interval, I was taken to meet the queen, Princess Margaret and Prince Philip. Sadly, now all passed.\" He met and danced with many of the great dancers of the day. \"I was dancing Puck in Midsummer Night\\'s Dream when Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev came to visit me in my dressing room.\" Another encounter was with famous heart-transplant surgeon Prof Chris Barnard. \"I was dancing in Coppélia, where all the toys come alive at night. I touched a doll\\'s heart as if to give it life and this struck a cord with Professor Barnard, who happened to be in the audience. When I came back to South Africa and was living with my mother, I received a letter brought by messenger. It was during apartheid and we thought it was the police. I was terrified. The letter just said: \\'Call this number.\\' I called the number and it was Chris Barnard, he said: \\'Johaar, I want to give you a big party.\\'\" At 95, Mosaval leads an ascetic life, adhering to Islamic beliefs. His biggest luxury is the occasional pepper steak. \"I live alone and my desire is to keep my independence.\" He recently renewed his driving licence and drove from his home in Lansdowne, Cape Town, to our meeting in the city centre. Like many ballet dancers, he has trouble with his feet, and has also undergone major heart surgery. \"They look after him like a jewel,\" Tina Smith, head curator at District Six Museum, tells me before going out in the rain to buy him a pepper steak which I think he\\'d been anticipating throughout our interview. Johaar returned to South Africa in 1973. \"I promised Dulcie Howes I\\'d come home to help our people,\" he says. As I left, I wanted to hug this small, adorable man who\\'s done so much for our country and culture. Mosaval will be honoured by the South African ballet and dance scene in \\'Dreaming Dance in District Six: The Johaar Mosaval Story\\'. The award-winning production takes place at the Artscape Opera House from March 2 to 4 2023.

      "Mbalula issues tough edict on Gcaleka vote Only death will be the acceptable excuses for skipping Gcaleka vote \"The only acceptable explanation for missing the vote on the appointment of public protector Kholeka Gcaleka is if you are dead.\" This is the stern warning from ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula to MPs during a caucus meeting in Johannesburg on Friday. Mbalula issued a three-line whip - telling the caucus that the ANC expects all its 230 MPs to be in parliament on September 11 for the vote that day, and they should all support the report recommending that Gcaleka be appointed as the new public protector. The National Assembly is due to vote on the section 189 report on the removal of Busisiwe Mkhwebane and the appointment of Gcaleka, who has been acting in the role during Mkhwebane\\'s suspension. Mkhwebane\\'s removal requires a two-thirds majority of the 400-seat house - 267 votes - while the appointment of Gcaleka requires 60%, or 240 votes. The ANC is expecting the report on Mkhwebane to be passed with ease as almost all parties save for the EFF and the African Transformation Movement support her removal. On Gcaleka, the ANC expects the IFP, Al Jama-ah, GOOD and other smaller parties to vote in support of her appointment. Only 10 additional votes would be required if all 230 ANC MPs vote, and vote as instructed. Mbalula told the caucus that he will not accept any explanation for missing the vote. \"He told us that he needs all 230 members of the ANC to be in parliament on the day and that no-one will give an excuse unless that person is dead,\" said an ANC MP who attended the meeting at Gallagher Estate. Mbalula and ANC chief whip Pemmy Majodina declined to comment. Insiders said Mbalula also took a swipe at the four MPs - including Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Zweli Mkhize - who defied party instructions in December last year that MPs should vote to reject the Phala Phala impeachment report. The secretary-general said he would be watching them closely this time around, the insiders said. The Sunday Times has previously reported that the ANC initiated a process of charging the four: Mkhize, who quit as health minister under a cloud last year; Dlamini-Zuma, who is now minister in the Presidency responsible for women, children & people with disabilities; former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo; and former mineral resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane. The Sunday Times understands Mbalula told the caucus that the four have been referred to the party\\'s national disciplinary committee (NDC) and will be hauled over the coals for being \"repeat offenders\" on the Phala Phala vote. They ignored instructions to oppose adoption of the section 89 report recommending an impeachment process for President Cyril Ramaphosa, and defied the party again in a vote this year on the creation of an ad hoc committee to look into the scandal. Mbalula told the meeting on Friday it was unfortunate that the organisation had taken such a long time to act on these \"ill-disciplined members\", one insider said. \"He issued a stern warning that come September 11, \\'You dare vote your own way, you will meet us.\\' He said that if it means parting ways with those who defy, so be it. He was clear that there are those who have defied the party twice before and that they\\'ve been referred to the NDC to act on their ill discipline.\" According to the insiders, the caucus gave Mbalula a standing ovation. Majodina is said to have told the caucus that her political assessment report on the party\\'s MPs was complete and had been sent to Luthuli House. The report has a bearing on the list process currently under way and could dent the chances of the four out-of-favour MPs returning to parliament after the elections next year. Majodina has previously told the Sunday Times she had submitted two reports relating to the conduct of Mkhize, Dlamini-Zuma, Mahumapelo and Zwane to Mbalula. The ANC instructed its MPs to vote against the impeachment report in December, and most of them did so. But Mkhize, Dlamini-Zuma, Mahumapelo and Zwane went against the party by either voting in favour of the report\\'s adoption or being absent during the crucial vote. Majodina said there was evidence that the four did not carry out a party mandate on two occasions. \"That is not an allegation; they must be processed. Each member in each party [must] toe the party line,\" she said. \"[They] are repeat offenders on [the] Phala Phala matter.\" July 22, 2023.ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula addresses the ANCWL 13th National Conference delegates at Nasrec EXPO Centre in Johannesburg.

      "Parliament\\'s ethics committee should take its job more seriously There was a time in the early 2000s when parliament\\'s joint ethics committee was one of the national legislature\\'s most respected, if not feared, structures. Under the leadership of National Assembly speaker the late Dr Frene Ginwala, the ethics committee was a parliamentary body no MP wanted to face. One of the committee\\'s better-known casualties was former ANC chief whip Tony Yengeni, who was pushed out of his role after failing to declare a vehicle benefit. He quit parliament in 2003 as the ethics committee was training its sights on him at the insistence of Ginwala, among other reasons. Several other current and former MPs have felt the wrath of the ethics committee, such as former communications minister Dina Pule, who was hauled over the coals for her failure to declare luxurious gifts from a romantic partner. But the committee appears to have lost its might and bite. It has been rendered a structure that MPs can afford to ignore. Its effectiveness as an ethics watchdog came under the spotlight this week after it issued findings against a number of MPs. It found police minister Bheki Cele guilty of breaching parliament\\'s ethics code of conduct for repeatedly shouting \"shut up\" at a civilian during a public event in Gugulethu. The committee ordered that Cele should be reprimanded by way of issuing a public apology during a live broadcast of a sitting of the National Assembly. But instead of showing remorse for his conduct, Cele cocked a snook at the committee. \"That\\'s the headline, Cele has been found guilty. And what\\'s even more laughable is the sanction, what Cele must do. No, it\\'s simple, we don\\'t agree. We don\\'t agree with this finding and the minister of police will be taking this on review,\" he said. The EFF\\'s Floyd Shivambu advanced a similar argument after the committee decided that he should forfeit a portion of his salary over payments received from a VBS-connected company. The committee did not cover itself in glory when it essentially cleared state capture-accused MPs, based on technicalities. Parliament\\'s chair of chairs Cedric Frolick failed to disclose a benefit he received when controversial company Bosasa paid for his accommodation. The committee passed the buck, saying the offence took place before the code of ethical conduct and disclosure of members\\' interests was adopted - therefore letting Frolick get away scot-free. What parliament\\'s ethics committee does matters not just to the MPs involved, but to the public at large. True, there are governance issues involved in what the committee has to adjudicate; the propriety of members comes under scrutiny. But beyond that MPs are supposed to be leaders in society, whose behaviour should be exemplary and beyond reproach. Their conduct affects the public image of the institution and the country. Similarly, the manner in which parliament deals with MPs who break its rules reflects on the seriousness, or otherwise, with which the national legislature takes itself. In light of this week\\'s committee rulings, which to many will look like mere slaps on the wrist for errant MPs, the lawmakers may want to introspect and review their ethics code. It is not in the interests of MPs or parliament to leave the public, which elects them, with the impression that the members are breed apart and a law unto themselves.\n",

      "Price-fixing law cannot be ignored Companies must realise they can be hauled over the coals for many issues Deneys Reitz THE spate of price-fixing investigations last year suggests that many South African employees are either unaware of the outright prohibition on price fixing by competitors imposed by the Competition Act or uncertain about which particular business practices this prohibition outlaws. Section 4(1)(b)(i) of the act prohibits competitors from directly or indirectly fixing a purchase or selling price or any other trading condition. Competitors cannot defend an agreement to fix prices on the basis that the price arrived at was fair or reasonable, that customers did not end up paying more than they would otherwise have done, or because the agreement was necessary to preserve the local industry or prevented job losses. Any agreement with a competitor to fix a purchase or selling price, or any component of those prices, is prohibited. This would not only include an agreement to fix the rand value of a purchase or selling price, but also one between competitors to hold prices at a predetermined level, to apply a particular pricing formula or methodology, to apply particular differences in pricing across a range of products or to use a common price list in negotiations with customers. Section 4(1)(b) also prohibits competitors from agreeing on the timing of price increases, reducing the rate by which prices are lowered, or reducing or eliminating discounts, specials or promotional allowances. Competitors may also not reach agreement on the quality of their products or material trading terms, such as credit criteria. Because section 4(1)(b) prohibits not only direct but also indirect price fixing, any agreement between competitors that hinders vigorous price competition or has a settling effect on pricing is likely to fall within the scope of the prohibition. The prohibition applies not only to a written or verbal agreement but also to any \"concerted practice\" between competitors that enables them to co-ordinate their pricing without any explicit agreement to do so. The cases investigated by the commission last year highlight the importance of understanding the nature and scope of the prohibition on price fixing, and illustrate the kinds of business practices that are regarded by the commission as a contravention of this prohibition. For example, in the reinforcing wire mesh products investigation, the commission alleged that various South African producers agreed to fix the prices at which they sold these products to their customers, including the discounts they offered them. A separate investigation related to whether producers of lightly galvanised wire and wire products were fixed. A subsidiary of Score (South Africa) later admitted to the commission that it had reached agreement on a national price list for wire and wire products with competitors Cape Gate, Allan\\'s Mesh and Henlock. In the mining roof bolts cartel investigation the commission alleged that suppliers discussed the selling prices of mining roof bolts and agreed on selling prices. Competitors participating in industry associations must ensure that their activities comply with the act. While it is usually permissible for industry associations to gather historical pricing and production information from industry participants - for example, to perform benchmarking exercises - only aggregated, historical information may be exchanged between competitors and published. The disclosure of current or planned pricing, cost or production information may be viewed as facilitating collusion between competitors. Even the disclosure of fairly dated information may raise competition-law concerns in the event that this provides a meaningful indication of future intended pricing or commercial strategies. Competition law complaint proceedings can expose companies to severe reputational risk and protracted and costly legal proceedings. Therefore, all companies should implement and maintain a comprehensive competition law training and compliance programme to prevent any contraventions of the act. OUTLAWED BUSINESS PRACTICES Section 4(1)(b) prohibits competitors from agreeing on: •The timing of price increases •Reducing the rate by which prices are lowered •Reducing or eliminating discounts, specials or promotional allowances •The quality of their products •Material trading terms, such as credit criteria Picture: STOCK.XCHNG\n",

Consider preparing Schweinshaxe and spätzle over the coals if you favour the Germans; or a piri piri prawn potjie for the Portugese; \"hutspot, rode kool met appeltjies\" for the Dutch or paprika-spiked Goulash if you\\'re keen on the Slovakians; or a patriotic West Coast seafood potjie to fly the flag for SA. Flavours from around the world were the centre of attraction when wine farmers in the Durbanville Wine Valley recently put the harvest to bed with food cooked on burning embers, wine from their cellars and a hefty dose of competitive spirit. \"With the eyes of the world on our country for the soccer world cup, we decided to get into the soccer spirit with a potjiekos gastro get-together themed The World in my Potjie,\" explains Michelle van Staden of the Durbanville Wine Valley Association. \"The black potjie is a symbol of our country\\'s warm hospitality and our own culinary diversity. While potjiekos purists have fairly strict rules on how a potjie should be cooked - such as layering the ingredients in a specific order, and stirring the pot being strictly verboten - our approach is easy-going. Like the braai, potjiekos is meant to be unifying; a fuss-free way of feeding the crowds with a feast of flavours.\" Righard Theron, chairman of the charming wine route with its views on the Atlantic Ocean and Table Bay, reckons that the World Cup will fuel the interest in other international food styles for years to come. \"Many of their national dishes are potjie-friendly, such as Cajun Jambalaya from America, chilli con carne from Mexico; Italian Osso Bucco, Spanish paella; British Lancashire hot pot and French cassoulet.\" The judging panel was led by renowned epicure and restaurateur Peter Veldsman, who ignited an interest in cauldron cooking as part of our country\\'s culinary heritage. \"Potjiekos has been part of South African life since the first settlement at the Cape,\" he notes. \"In those days, food was cooked in an open hearth in the kitchen in a black cast-iron pot with legs so that the coals could be scraped under the pot.\" The adventurous judging team awarded Bloemendal\\'s festive take on Brazilian food culture as the overall winner. \"We interpreted the national dish Feijoada by exchanging the traditional pork with lamb, as Durbanville is traditionally a sheep-rearing region,\" says Mike Crawford, who led his team to gourmet gold. \"We used copious amounts of Bloemendal Malbec as a key flavour.\" The feijoada was served on maize meal pap flavoured with shavings of biltong, bringing together iconic tastes from two continents. The dish was rounded off with herb farofa, a crusty topping of bread crumbs, pancetta, spring onions, thyme, rosemary and melted butter. Nitida Wine Farm\\'s team spirit and table setting was another match-clincher. \"We interpreted American culture, symbolised by super-sized portions, Disney characters, cowboys and Indians,\" says Bernhard Veller, the Nitida cellar master. D\\'Aria received a special nod from the judges for their daring \"Pirates of D\\'Aria\" concept - representing a motley crew travelling the seven seas to collect cauldron recipes. Also highly prized was De Grendel\\'s Algerian Lamb Shank potjie perfumed with cardamom and cumin, matched with perfumy De Grendel Winifred. Cassia at Nitida, Durbanville Hills and De Grendel in the Durbanville Wine Valley will offer food and football festivities during the World Cup.

Sayco, an Argentinian animal, picked Argentina to beat Germany in the quarterfinals, but then no one\\'s perfect. Even though Paul has had an impressive fortune-telling career so far, he has been remembered for mistakenly picking Germany to beat Spain in the Euro 2008 final. Spain beat Germany 1-0 in that game. Unfortunately, after Sayco miss-picked Argentina to beat Germany, it appears he has not been allowed to renew his rivalry with Paul. While Paul picks his winners by choosing a mussel from between two boxes, where each box is designated with the competing countries\\' flags, Sayco has to undergo a more difficult selection process. He has to choose to play with one of two balls thrown at him. The balls are coloured according to the countries\\' flags. Perhaps if Sayco got to sit on his behind all day and pick fish from a box, he would be more successful in the soccer punditry business. Meanwhile, since the South African Football Association is in such a dilemma about picking Pitso Mosimane or Gavin Hunt as the next Bafana Bafana coach, maybe it should seek out a psychic sea creature at the Two Oceans Aquarium to make the choice. Judge for yourself, my lord SINCE so many of the Insider\\'s friends and colleagues are journalists or editors - and are always being hauled over the coals for spelling people\\'s names wrong - it fills him with a certain amount of glee when others, a court stenographer say, or possibly even a judge, make the same sorts of mistake.

Poor Vusi Pikoli\\'s first name, which is actually Vusumzi, is spelt Busumzi. The Insider hopes this is the result of \"b\" being next to \"v\" on a qwerty keyboard and not a reflection on the quality of the judgment as a whole. Fox\\'s Future fans forestalled SOUTH Africans who remember watching the Back to the Future blockbusters at drive-ins or the bioscope will have to wait another five years to celebrate Future Day. An Australian website recently reported that July 5 2010 was supposed to be the target date entered into the DeLorean time machine by Dr Emmett Brown, a character in the films, according to the UK\\'s Total film magazine. Fans worldwide, including some members of the Insider\\'s extended family, planned Back to the Future-themed parties and marathon movie viewing events to celebrate the popular science fiction film. However, the Daily What blog ruined the celebrations in a piece called Fake Fakery of the Day, by showing a list of all the dates entered into the machine. July 5 2010 was not one of them. The next closest date from now that was, verifiably, entered into the DeLorean is October 21 2015.

      "Holding an audience and the performing art of retail WHEN I walk into Vida e CaffÅ for my daily fix, I\\'m expecting the Vida vibe. It\\'s the reason I go there and not next door. I look forward to seeing the barista, who\\'s a bit left of centre, but smooth and sophisticated at the same time. I\\'m anticipating some friendly banter, some witty comment on the ailing global economy while he froths up my brew. I go there because I\\'m expecting the Vida brand. I\\'m not expecting surliness, disinterest or boredom. So when I get the cold shoulder, I\\'m prepared to show them my back. Retail branding is theatre and, as a paying spectator, I\\'m willing to walk out if the production is lousy. I\\'ll also be quick to spread the word. Times are tough and when it comes to parting with my hard-earned cash, I want every aspect of the stage set, from the backdrop and the props to the lighting and the sound, to ignite my senses. Consumers are notoriously promiscuous when it comes to brand loyalty - perhaps even more so now that the recession has arrested our spending and focused our attention even more closely on value and service delivery. And in sectors where there is price and product parity, such as in fast foods and petrol stations, getting customers up close and personal with the brand experience can be the difference between winning and losing. Research suggests only 5% of consumers are loyal to the brand of one product group, while 70% of our brand selections are made in-store and 68% of our buying decisions are unplanned. Attract and capture is the driver of success. So who\\'s doing it well and what\\'s their secret? Well, given that a worker in the quick service restaurant industry has about 30 seconds to interact with the customer, speed and skill are essential. And with increasing brand convergence and price and product parity, it\\'s increasingly up to individuals at the coal face to influence consumer choice. Individual behaviour, developing relationships and customer service can be either a brand saviour or destroyer. We\\'re more likely to be loyal to a person who\\'s given us great service than we are to a product. Employee behaviour has become so important that brand specialists have turned to psychologists and behaviourists so we can better understand and develop the emotional intelligence of our clients\\' brands. Every aspect of an organisation is directed by performance against brand behaviour. Visitors to the V& A Waterfront mall in Cape Town will have noticed the new Nespresso store, prominently positioned and instantly alluring. If they\\'ve been into the store, they would have encountered brand ambassadors, who are interested and interesting, technically knowledgeable and passionate about their work. Training\\'s the big issue. From franchises to large national operations, the same principle applies. Every person in an organisation can influence how well a brand is brought to life. Customers want a fantastic brand experience - even if it\\'s \"just\" a cup of coffee on the go. At the Disney corporation, every employee, from the lowliest cleaner to the most senior manager, is recognised for their value as a brand activist and they\\'re trained equally to deliver brand Disney. The waitress at Primi Piatti is actually one of the reasons I go there - often. She\\'s just what I expect from the Primi brand: she\\'s a proud \"meeter and greeter\" and she oozes that definitive Primi attitude. For my money, it\\'s one of the best local brands because it lives up to its promise. My expectations are met, time after time. Once the stage is set, the actors need to perform. How good are South African brands at doing this? I think I\\'ll mull this over during another performance at my local Primi theatre. •Leigh is director of HKLM Group.\n",

      "High price for a safer society THE national crime statistics released by the South African Police Service (SAPS) show the downward trend remains on track. The overall number of serious crimes reported to the SAPS fell from 2,12-million cases last year to 2,07-million this year. Most encouragingly, murder has declined consistently since the advent of democracy in 1994, albeit from an horrifically high base, as have other interpersonal violent crimes, such as attempted murder and serious assault. These figures indicate that the SAPS is doing a lot right in combating crime, but they only show part of the story. In some cases, improved policing, and increased reporting of crimes, can perversely affect crime statistics. A good example of this would be the reported 4,5% increase in drunk driving. It is hard to believe that the increase in visible policing and the number of roadblocks has resulted in more drunk driving - rather, it is likely that more people who once drove drunk with impunity are now being apprehended. Furthermore, some of the figures that were released point to a displacement of crime - most notably the decrease in bank robberies and marked increase in ATM bombings. The raw percentages also need to be interrogated: the 61,5% increase in ATM bombings translates to 152 new cases, and while this is an alarming number, it is possible most are the work of a few syndicates rather than a national pandemic. It should not be forgotten, however, that at the heart of these positive crime figures lies a terrifying reality for police personnel. Although the number of policemen and women killed in the line of duty has declined slightly, the figure remains shockingly high. Since the beginning of the year, 65 officers have been killed, compared with 94 in the whole of last year and 107 in 2009. It is possible that the unacceptably high number of police deaths is also the result of more active policing but, more than anything, it shows the size of the debt of gratitude SA owes to most of the country\\'s often underappreciated law enforcement officers. A safer society and lower crime rate are not the responsibility of the police alone. To achieve further reductions, police need the support of the public, the government and judicial system. Tough policing is good, but there is an unacceptable price attached to it. Police officers at the coal face of law enforcement should be given the training, protection and respect they deserve.\n",

      "Seeing society in a pile of data like a statue in a marble block SOME time in 1984, I visited the Swedish foreign ministry. Opinion survey results showing that 74% of urban Africans opposed the disinvestment of foreign companies from SA hit the headlines while I was in Stockholm. The news was not what many people in Sweden wished to hear at a time when the campaign for the economic isolation of SA was intensifying. Who was this man Lawrence Schlemmer? I was asked about the author of the survey. Was he reliable? Well, I said, he\\'s the president of the South African Institute of Race Relations. He is also one of the top social scientists in SA and you can be sure his survey methodology is professional and his interpretations of the data painstakingly careful. This didn\\'t go down well with the Swedish officials. Perhaps, they said, the Africans in the survey didn\\'t understand the issues at stake. Funny you should say that, I replied, for the government in SA uses the same argument to deny them the vote. Though there were one or two exceptions, most subsequent surveys confirmed Schlemmer\\'s findings. Fast forward to 2001, and Schlemmer once again upset the apple cart. In a survey commissioned by the institute he found that the burning issue for the vast majority of South Africans was unemployment - not, as so many people claimed, racism. Essop Pahad, then minister in the Presidency, was having none of this. Schlemmer, he said, was simply foolish. People walked out of meetings when Schlemmer presented his findings, politically incorrect as they were at the time. But that was a key point about Schlemmer, who died last month. In a country where so many ostensible & opinion leaders& in business, academia, civil society and the media are often no more than slaves to political correctness, he was a beacon of honesty, integrity and truth. But this was only one of the reasons he was in a class of his own as a social scientist. Another was his never-ending quest for hard data based on market research. Like Michelangelo able to see a statue inside a block of marble, he could discern not merely how opinions might be moving but also much about the very nature of our society from piles of printouts. There were other reasons Schlemmer was sui generis. He seemed to know every nook and cranny of this society. As a one-time social worker, he had been at the coal face. His knowledge of SA was subtle, profound - and fascinating. And he was often able to produce facts contradicting the claims of those purporting to speak for particular constituencies. Schlemmer was not only a man of liberal convictions, but one with the pioneering spirit to act them out. Notably, in the early 1980s, he played a leading role in helping to implement Mangosuthu Buthelezi\\'s initiatives to break SA\\'s political logjam by planning for nonracial government in KwaZulu and Natal. This was at a time when few people believed negotiations on a nonracial constitution were possible. That his office and home were firebombed in 1986 testifies to how his boldness as a liberal engendered hostility on the hard left. Politically unpopular though it might have been with some, his involvement in KwaZulu and Natal was prescient. It was not long afterwards that the National Party itself recognised the future lay in negotiation. With his ear always close to the ground, Schlemmer was one of the first to discern early signs of the shift in Afrikaner thinking that eventually helped to pave the way for FW de Klerk\\'s momentous actions of February 2 1990. In 1970, 20 years before then, Schlemmer predicted that & a mellowing of Afrikaner nationalism& would help SA and its government adjust to realities at odds with its racial ideology. The initial changes would be small, but they would ultimately snowball. The next 20 years proved him right. & 8226;Kane-Berman is CE of the South African Institute of Race Relations.

      "Rule of law Disregard for constitution led to financial crisis in Limpopo THE continuing spat between PresidentJacob Zuma\\'sCabinet and the provincial executive committee of the African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo has factional political dimensions that have hogged the news headlines. But the crisis in governance in the province, which neighbours Zimbabwe in more than one way, is a matter for legal, rather than political, analysis. The system of government chosen by the South African people has been called a & quasifederal& one. This is an outcome of a compromise reached when our reunified country emerged from the negotiations for a new dispensation to replace the balkanisation policy of choice under apartheid, in which quasi-independent & homelands& were scattered about the landscape. The & quasifederal& accommodation was reached because there was no consensus on the federal system favoured by the National Party (and the Inkatha Freedom Party) and the unitary state the ANC envisaged when it came to the table to negotiate an end to the armed struggle. The nine provinces of the new SA have certain competencies parcelled out to them in the constitution itself. Schedule four to the constitution lists & functional areas of concurrent national and provincial legislative competence& while schedule five lists & functional areas of exclusive provincial legislative competence& When it comes to running provinces, the buck stops with the premiers and their provincial cabinets - they are & accountable individually and collectively to the legislature for the exercise of their powers and the performance of their functions& They may not undertake any other paid work, act in a way that is inconsistent with their office, expose themselves to the risk of a conflict of interests or use their position or any information entrusted to them to enrich themselves or to improperly benefit any other person. In their turn, the provincial legislatures are required by the constitution to provide for mechanisms to ensure that all provincial executive organs of state are accountable to them and to maintain oversight of the exercise of provincial executive authority and of any provincial organ of state. The fact that the provincial legislature in Limpopo appears to have been passive in the face of the alleged financial meltdown and effective bankruptcy (at least according to the national Cabinet\\'s assessment of the situation of the province) is remarkable. It appears that the notion that all power resides in the ANC (bruited abroad by the Limpopo provincial executive committee of the ANC) has caused constitutional amnesia that absolves the members of the provincial legislature from doing their duty and exercising their responsibilities. The party list system for their election, according to the proportional representation system in place, is to blame for the dysfunctional relationship between voters and politicians. Further, the ability of party bosses to pick and choose who gets on to, and stays on, the party list has so emasculated legislatures that their accountability and oversight functions are all too often more illusory than real. Proportional representation across the board at national and provincial levels of government comes at an unaffordable price. Even at national level, the post-arms-deals history of a supposedly nonpartisan committee such as Parliament\\'s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) does not make for illuminating reading. The executive interference in the arms deals investigations had the unfortunate effect of gutting Scopa. The role of public servants who are at the coal face of service delivery in the provinces should not be omitted in any legal analysis of the problems flowing from the intervention by the national government in the governance of Limpopo. The public service is enjoined to & loyally execute the lawful policies of the government of the day& Self-evidently, this does not include cronyism, corruption and cadre deployment in the public administration, all of which are illegal. Nor may procurement of goods and services be effected otherwise than in accordance with a system that is & fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective& These criteria are constitutionally prescribed. They are also backed up by legislation, regulations and practice manuals. Public servants are bound by the founding values of the constitution and, more specifically, by the values and principles spelt out especially for them in section 195 of the constitution. Foremost among these are a high standard of professional ethics, efficiency, transparency and accountability. & Services must be provided impartially, fairly, equitably and without bias& according to the express wording of the section. The requirements of this provision of our supreme law are all but a dead letter in Limpopo, and indeed elsewhere in SA. This makes complete and unfortunate nonsense of the last words of section two, which says: & This constitution is the supreme law of the Republic; law or conduct inconsistent with it is invalid, and the obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled& It is clear, on whichever version of the goings-on in Limpopo, that there has been conduct inconsistent with the constitution in abundance. The intervention by the national Cabinet is aimed at steadying the ship of state by addressing the effects of the alleged misconduct, malfeasance and misfeasance in the functioning of the provincial administration. It is perhaps preferable in the longer term to seek out the causes of the trouble and to address them. Lack of respect for the rule of law may feature prominently as a cause of the general malaise in Limpopo. Cadre deployment in the public administration is at the root of much of the trouble, and it, in and of itself, is an illegal practice. It is certainly not a & good human resource management and career development& practice, as laid down in section 195(1) of the constitution. The national intervention, although sanctioned by the constitution, is not necessarily the cure to the problems that allegedly exist. The Cabinet announcement is particularly vague about which of the provisions of section 100(1) (b) apply, although it does seem apparent from the nature of the intervention that the plan is to & prevent that province from taking unreasonable action that is prejudicial to the interests ... of the country as a whole& as the section puts it. Certainly, it would be prejudicial to allow Limpopo to wallow in its alleged insolvency or simply to throw good money after bad without any prospect of improvement in the situation on the ground and in the stability of the finances of the province. Whatever transpires in the faction fighting, all of the adversaries would do well to consider the legal framework within which they are meant to operate. It is not helpful to cry foul on the basis that others are doing the same and getting away with it. If there has been wrongdoing, it needs to be addressed with the full might of the law. Nor does it assist to single out a political adversary in a faction fight for & special treatment& when equality before the law is foundational to our democratic dispensation. All wrongdoing, irrespective of the province or the faction in which it occurs, should be addressed if the rule of law is to survive. & 8226;Hoffman SC is a director of the Institute for Accountability in Southern Africa. \\'When it comes to running provinces, the buck stops with the premiers and their provincial cabinets\\'\n",

      "Bad press seems to emerge from within Sascoc JUST what in the blazes is going on at the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc)? Negative headlines have become the organisation\\'s constant companion and it seems every day is an adventure over there. And you certainly do not need a PhD to figure out that the source of most of these unflattering headlines has been someone from within the organisation itself. Oh yes, I said it. The frightening thing is, someone stands to profit handsomely from this chaotic state of affairs and the constant portrayal of Sascoc as something akin to a typical day at the Noord Street taxi rank. There is method in the madness and all this is not continuing just for the hell of it. And, not content with the regular negativity surrounding them, Sascoc have now decided that it is probably a good idea to also take on the South African Football Association (Safa). The two organisations are involved in a very public spat and you have to wonder where this is going. To put you in the picture, we are told that Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula is not happy about some of the things happening at Safa. He has question marks about the state of Bafana Bafana, the equally fumbling junior national teams, the millions of dollars deposited by Fifa into the 2010 World Cup Legacy Trust, and match-fixing allegations, among a host of other concerns. Rather interesting when you consider the fact that I have run into the minister in the company of the selfsame Safa officials he is apparently not happy with on a few occasions this year alone. Anyway, initial reports said that Sascoc was investigating Safa and the suggestion was that the soccer bosses were in a spot of bother. Now I see that the rhetoric has been toned down a notch and it has become a pleasant request for information, not an investigation. Sascoc CEO Tubby Reddy does not recall ever calling this thing an investigation and is actually distressed by the very suggestion that those words ever escaped his lips. Of course, Safa CEO Robin Petersen is hopping mad because he has begun the thankless task of changing public opinion of Bafana and the organisation itself. Tough job when even President Jacob Zuma turns to the selfsame Bafana Bafana when he needs to inject comic relief into his speeches. Tough ask indeed. So now the two organisations and Mbalula will meet on March 9 to get to the bottom of all this. We sure hope that Sascoc has not forgotten that we are a few months away from the London Olympics, in the midst of all the excitement. & 8226;So, Safa has decided to move its press conference to tomorrow to announce the Bafana Bafana squad to face Senegal in Durban. Safa insists that this decision was & at the request of eThekwini municipality& Ahem. The cynics among us are already wondering if this is not actually a cleverly disguised ploy to protect coach Pitso Mosimane from the Johannesburg media after his rant last month. Many journalists in Johannesburg have been itching for an opportunity to haul the man over the coals following his stinging criticism of the media after he was blamed for Bafana\\'s failure to qualify for the recent African Nations Cup in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. The hacks were understandably peeved when Safa announced yesterday that the thing was moved to Durban. Really, Safa, how long can you guys keep this up? Mosimane will have to face the fiery mob at some stage. ntlokom@bdfm.co.za\n",

      "Changes afoot at the coalface of labour relations Doing nothing makes Zuma an accessory SOMETHING really dramatic is taking place at grassroots level in SA\\'s labour relations that could reshape both the labour environment and politics in SA. The tip of the iceberg is visible at Impala Platinum, which could soon become the first major segment of the mining industry to oust the Congress of South African Trade Unions\\' (Cosatu\\'s) largest affiliate, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). But perhaps the most unrecognised aspect of this new environment is the role played by SA\\'s labour legislation, which has always been a general problem, but now threatens to become a specific problem for a whole new set of reasons. How important the developments at Impala will turn out to be remains difficult to answer, but they are dramatic enough to warrant a much closer look than they are getting at the moment. Impala has already lost 120000oz and about R2,4bn in the strike in March. The new wildcat strike, now over, this week cost it another 6000oz. For shareholders, the industry has been a pretty miserable investment, although Impala has not fallen dramatically out of proportion with its megarival Anglo American Platinum, and a lot less than Lonmin and Aquarius. The share price of both the big players are 25% down over a one-year period, more or less in line with the big diversified miners. It doesn\\'t help that labour relations at the mines have been very troubled. Remember, this is the industry that has been earmarked as base of SA\\'s industrial rebound. The repeated & unprotected& strikes at Impala invite a whole range of questions. Why Impala? Why the platinum industry? Why now? Broadly speaking, the answers lie in the interplay between the changing character of Cosatu, the essential conception of SA\\'s labour legislation, and the changing nature of South African society. Impala has been at the vortex of these problems, which have a good chance of spreading. All of these contesting forces led to an unusual development at Impala this past week: a decision to verify the claim by the NUM\\'s rival, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), that it represents the majority of the roughly 20000-person workforce. If Amcu\\'s claim is true, it will be the first major inroad into Cosatu\\'s dominant position since democracy. In itself, the change will not be dramatic for the NUM, which claims about 300000 members. But symbolically, it may herald a new phase. Amcu has been active for a number of years, but only recently has it seen its membership surge in an industry. Why platinum has been so successful is hard to know. Poor leadership from the NUM could be a factor. Traditionally, the NUM president handles the gold and the coal portfolios, and the deputy president handles platinum and the smaller sectors. The current deputy president is Piet Matosa, seen by platinum shop stewards and workers as a Cosatu head office appointee. He was attacked at an Impala mine three years ago, and he unfortunately lost an eye. His position was contested at the NUM congress this weekend, although he managed to face down the challenge. But another problem has to do with the nature of platinum mining. Unusually, the industry is strongly weighted towards the lower levels of the salary hierarchy. With the end of job reservation and the gradual elevation of NUM members up the skills and pay scale, shop stewards have been selected from this small core of better paid workers. As society has changed, the distance now between this select band of senior employees and base-level employees is pretty marked for the first time. Amcu is a much less sophisticated union, much more inclined to bypass the Labour Relations Act and go on unauthorised strikes, as we have seen this year. Its representatives come out of the base of the salary structure, and therefore presumably have a better connection with the largest part of the workforce. They have a much more intense focus on workplace matters, and there is some feeling the NUM is distant, focused on political issues, and NUM leaders are out for themselves in the world of politics. Whatever the reasons, Amcu now needs to be taken seriously. This is where the legislative environment becomes an issue. The Labour Relations Act was passed in 1995, to bring labour legislation in line with the new constitution. Less recognised was its role as a big & thank you& from the ANC to Cosatu. The legislation didn\\'t stop at formalising the right to strike as the constitution required, it also weighted the labour relations balance heavily in favour of labour - something recognised only at that point by the diminutive Democratic Party. It did so by introducing mechanisms such as the closed shop and the agency shop, which forces workers to join the majority union and which allows the union to charge all workers membership fees. It\\'s a little known fact that legislation allows a company to fire an employee who refuses to join a union with which it has a closed shop relationship. The legislation is the major cause of SA\\'s sclerotic labour market and the big reason it has been steadily declining in world competitiveness surveys. What is relevant is the extent to which the legislation favours majoritarianism. The concept behind the legislation is that there will be one, big union in every industry, and the strategy was intended to create a situation in which Cosatu particularly would rule the roost. It was assumed that this would help to create labour peace and that Cosatu would always be the moderate, reasonable, well-led organisation it was in the early 1990s. It was assumed Cosatu could be relied on not to become belligerent, and that labour relations would improve in this majority-favouring environment. However, the opposite has happened; working days lost to strikes are reaching extreme levels, and the huge power bestowed on Cosatu has turned into a political nightmare for the ANC, which Cosatu now leads by the nose. For aspirant unions outside Cosatu, the result is a Game of Thrones scenario; you have only one way to win, and that is to deliver a knock-out blow. Impala\\'s current position is telling; it is legally obliged to ignore the representatives of the majority of its workforce and negotiate with the union representing a small slice. The process of de-recognising the NUM and recognising Amcu will take months, if it happens at all. Another factor is competition between unions, and here the politics will also to be tough. Many mining operations include smelting and other industrial operations. As a result, there appears to be more competition for support between the Zuma-supporting NUM and the more ambivalent National Union of Metalworkers of SA. How this plays out will be interesting. Overall, it may the premature to declare a new, difficult phase of labour relations in SA. But the early fault lines are definitely visible. I\\'VE written several times about my problems with the Brics concept, so it\\'s refreshing to see alternative views. One of the most interesting is the book Breakout Nations by Ruchir Sharma. The Bric nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China) idea seems too closely wedded to straight-line extrapolation, often expressed in the year China will overtake the US as the world\\'s biggest economy. Sharma\\'s put-down of this idea is telling: & As much as we all love the speculative titillation of futurology, no one can forecast the next century with any credibility and, more importantly, be held accountable for it,& he writes. Instead, he says, each country should be examined for its own specific characteristics. He also focuses less on the race in absolute gross domestic product (GDP) and more on GDP per capita. GDP size is a completely spurious measure when it comes to economic wellbeing, because countries with large populations have an obvious cumulative advantage. GDP per capita is the more comparable measure, and more inclusive. Actually, it turns out the next wave of & breakout nations& may not include any of the Brics, he says. China is slowing, its malls are empty and its labour market competitiveness is eroding. China\\'s growth is very dependent on the cheap money policies of first world nations. India\\'s tiny GDP per capita means it should easily outpace the rest of the world, but he says India has many other weaknesses. He hardly has time for Russia and Brazil, which he sees as functions of commodity markets. The real breakouts will be South Korea, Indonesia, the Czech Republic, Poland and possibly Turkey. And SA? SA, he says, is stuck in a kind of time warp. During apartheid, SA developed one of the most top-heavy forms of capitalism, with much of the economy under state control and the rest in hands of a few dominant cartels. The ANC kept that basic structure, with itself now the dominant ruling party, & backed by its allies in perhaps the most powerful union movement in the developing world. None of these power centres - not the state, not the private companies, not the ANC or its union allies - seems to have much sense of urgency about ramping growth.& Pretty spot on, I think. OUTSIDE this huge debate about youth wage subsidies and freedom to paint private parts, one small thing really irks me. Taking questions in Parliament, which most democratic leaders do fairly regularly but which in SA only seems to happen twice a year, President Jacob Zuma was predictably asked about police crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli. Zuma\\'s reply was that Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa had appointed a task team to investigate aspects of this matter, while the inspector-general of intelligence was also probing aspects within her mandate. & Everything possible was being done to address the matter,& he said. But the appointments, suspensions, reinstatements, transfers, in government departments were the responsibility of those departments & and not the president& He takes the same & I wash my hands& approach to a host of other issues, including analyst Moeletsi Mbeki\\'s criticism at the weekend, citing & procedure& But if there is illegality involved, then for pity\\'s sake, it\\'s absolutely up to him to get stuck in, and damn quickly too. It should be axiomatic that you can\\'t steal money from taxpayers by hiring your mates to do nothing. He needs to demonstrate unequivocally this is unacceptable behaviour, because if he doesn\\'t he is effectively encouraging it and is effectively an accessory.

      "Another week of transport strike will take toll on business Economics correspondent SHOULD the strike by transport workers enter a third week, the effect on businesses, business confidence, as well as consumers will worsen, South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Neren Rau cautioned in an interview yesterday. His comments followed the release of a weakened business confidence indicator by the business grouping. Mr Rau said current reports from the chamber\\'s small and medium-sized businesses were of shortages at fuel stations and cash machines, primarily in Gauteng. & If the strike continues, we\\'re going to experience reports of trading disruptions. If it extends to four weeks, we would start to be concerned about the GDP (gross domestic product) impact,& he said. Some 20,000 road freight industry workers are on a wage strike that started almost two weeks ago. Truck drivers, most of whom are affiliated to the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union, want a 12% salary increase while employers have offered 8.5% effective from March. Yesterday, the South African Municipal Workers Union said a march by 5,000 council workers in Limpopo tomorrow will be a precursor to national protest action over wage parity and against corruption in local government. Public service workers have not downed tools this year, despite wage negotiations at local and provincial levels. Public sector strikes are generally the most disruptive, particularly in the municipal sector, the coal face of service delivery. Municipal worker unions and the South African Local Government Association are involved in a protracted legal battle over the implementation of a wage curve in the local government sector. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant yesterday addressed the transport workers\\' negotiators. Although the strike has so far involved less violence than that seen on platinum mines in August, sporadic incidences of property damage by strikers have been reported. However, analysts believe the transport strike has the potential to become more damaging than the industrial action in the platinum sector mainly due to its close links to other sectors. & Even though the mining strike was severe, it was mainly in platinum. The transport strike affects all sectors of the economy and could have a much worse effect on economic growth, depending on how long it lasts,& said Marina Willemse, economist at Efficient Group. & But we must note that we haven\\'t yet really seen productive sectors being severely affected.& Ms Willemse said they were already forecasting lower growth in the third quarter following the work stoppages during the quarter. & We see economic growth at 2% in the third quarter,& she said. The business formation raises these concerns amid declining business confidence levels mainly due to the global economic slowdown, and partly due to work stoppages caused by strikes, which together weigh heavily on business sentiment. The chamber\\'s business confidence index fell to 91.7 points last month from 95.0 in August. & This is deeply concerning. The BCI (business confidence index) is not finding its path towards the critical level of 100,& Mr Rau said. With Natasha Marrian\n",

Unfortunately the theoretical (read statutory) foundation of banking secrecy and how things pan out in real life are often very different - as high net worth individuals on both sides of the Atlantic can attest to.

It was a qualified legal right arising from a contract. Locally, a banker\\'s duty of confidentiality had been recognised as early as 1914. Judge Traverso concluded: & It seems to me that for considerations of public policy the relationship between a bank and its client must be of a confidential nature. Equally - for considerations of public policy - this duty is subject to being overridden by a greater public interest.& She also noted that, although the duty not to disclose rests with the bank, the privilege not to have the details of the dealings with the bank disclosed belonged to the client. It was therefore the client alone who could invoke this privilege and insist on the bank keeping its client\\'s information confidential. But often there is a disconnect between what the law says and what happens at the coal face. The theft of confidential bank data and the on-selling of it to revenue authorities is big business these days. A & gold mine& of data stolen from the LGT bank (owned by the Lichtenstein royal family) during 2008 found its way to the German tax authorities via an LGT employee, who received €4.2m. The data was used, among other things, to convict the CEO of Deutsche Post of tax evasion. Germany\\'s Constitutional Court expressly ruled that such stolen data could be used in further tax probes: & The constitution knows no rules saying that a legally flawed collection of evidence in any case bars the use of that evidence.& In February 2010, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia bought stolen discs containing the names of approximately 1,500 German account holders with Swiss bank Credit Suisse. Despite criticism, the UK Revenue and Customs authority immediately approached Berlin to purchase the stolen data in order to detect potential UK tax evaders with hidden Swiss accounts. The Dutch, Belgian and Austrian governments also showed strong buying interest. In October 2010, the man suspected of the Swiss data theft (and who allegedly got €2.5m for it), but was arrested by Swiss authorities for the theft, was found dead in his prison cell. Police said it looked like suicide. As recently as late August this year Swiss private bank Julius Baer confirmed that it had discovered a & case of data misuse& The bank said that a Zurich employee acted alone and had been arrested. The thief had been paid & an undisclosed sum& by the German tax authorities. The amounts paid by revenue authorities to bank data thieves in Europe are paltry compared to what the IRS has on offer in the US. Under the IRS whistle-blower regime, an informant could potentially collect up to 30% of the proceeds in instances where the amount in dispute exceeds $2m. On September 11 2012, it was announced that the IRS had paid $104m (approximately R820m) to one Bradley Birkenfeld who earlier supplied the IRS with in-depth information on how Swiss bank UBS had helped US clients to evade tax. According to Birkenfeld\\'s lawyers it could be the largest pay-out ever to a single whistle-blower. The award by the IRS followed Birkenfeld\\'s exceptional cooperation and took into account the extensive information he gave on the UBS tax-fraud scheme. Birkenfeld\\'s offering to the IRS was used during 2009 to strong-arm UBS into a $780m settlement with the IRS. (Incidentally, as a UBS private banker, Birkenfeld once smuggled diamonds into the US by concealing them in toothpaste. This was the exceptional service UBS high-value customers received. He served three years jail for his role in the UBS tax fraud scheme but indicated that he will seek a presidential pardon.) The OECD published a report on October 26 2011 entitled: The Era of Bank Secrecy is Over. The first sentence reads: & In April 2009, G20 leaders took action to end the era of bank secrecy.& The OECD must be smiling at the support its efforts at destroying bank secrecy have been getting from banking insiders who have access to sensitive client data. Of course the banks are not doing themselves any favours: HSBC\\'s large-scale money laundering on behalf of cocaine cartels was documented in a mid-July US Senate report. That will mean more pressure on banks everywhere. The chairman of the Senate Committee already said & ultimately, the rest of us are forced to pay more on our tax bills to make up for those who shirk their taxpaying responsibilities& Locally, information provided by South African banks to the South African Revenue Service (SARS) as & third-party data& features as an important cog in SARS\\'s compliance plan. The SARS Annual Report says: & The use of third party data to verify self-assessments by taxpayers and to perform risk-profiling is a growing trend in international tax administration.& Sources of third party data range from financial institutions, employers, credit bureaus to other government agencies like the Department of Home Affairs. Going forward revenue authorities will increase their attacks on bank secrecy. Banks will see ever-widening and invasive information requests. The treasure troves of bank data have been prised open with help from bank employees eyeing lucrative whistle-blower pay-outs. Legal precedent telling bank clients that bank secrecy is alive and well, and should be respected (by revenue authorities as well), is unfortunately only part of the story.

      "Medium-term budget policy statement debate Summit TV takes a look at Pravin Gordhan\\'s medium-term budget policy statement with a panel of experts, and the need for South Africa can prevent an \\'Arab Spring\\' Summit Transcripts Services. 26 October 2012 SHESHI Kaniki is a senior economist at Momentum; Prof Steven Friedman is a director at the Centre for the Study of Democracy; Adam Habib is a political analyst and deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Johannesburg; and Krister Janse van Rensburg is deputy general secretary at union federation Fedusa. SUMMIT TV: What does the medium-term budget policy statement (MTBPS) mean to you and your investments? South Africa has revised revenue collection projections downwards for the first time, but Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan tried to depict a sound trajectory - though some are sceptical that he can make up for lower tax collection by reining in spending and maladministration by municipalities as promised. Sheshi, something we were not expecting was the downward revision in revenue collection... SHESHI KANIKI: Yes, that\\'s definitely historic - but with current domestic and global conditions not entirely unexpected. We are not growing anywhere near where we need to be - the minister projected growth of around 2.5% this year, down from 3% last year. Clearly the economic climate is not conducive to revenue generation hence the downward revision of R5bn to the fiscus. STV: It\\'s quite sobering... ADAM HABIB: I think it\\'s a financially prudent budget - but given our development needs I\\'m worried about that. Having said that, we couldn\\'t have had anything more radical. I think given the context of both global conditions, with the slowdown in Europe, and in particular the recent mining strikes and the impact of these strikes, it\\'s a very reasonable budget. What worried me more was the actual commentary, where I thought Tim Harris from the Democratic Alliance was particularly wrong when he compared the National Development Plan (NDP) to the New Growth Path (NGP). I think the biggest challenge in South Africa is inequality, where the mining strikes are a symptom of that. I think the & Marie-Antoinesque& attitude of the Democratic Alliance and the many private-sector economists on inequality and its impacts is a danger in our society and I think we need to take it more seriously than they do. STV: Interesting, because the minister, in his delivery of the MTBPS, did say that the crisis in the mining sector means we need a new social contract... ADAM HABIB: He did, and I do think we need that. What we often forget is the social compact is not simply labour giving everything - it does require political and economic elites and corporates to say, & This is what we are prepared to put on the table....& When I listen to private-sector economists I never hear them saying what sacrifices are going to be made by the corporate sector - all I hear is & we want deregulation of the labour market& and & we want labour to make concessions& That\\'s what I describe as the & Marie-Antoinesque& attitude - a complete ignorance of the dangers of inequality. I often say that our economists need a good dose of Sociology 101... STV: Steven, when we saw the downgrades by the ratings agencies Standard & Poor\\'s and Moody\\'s and the minister returned from Hong Kong, he seemed rather shocked - there was a tone that needed to be set and a message saying & we are still on the same fiscal trajectory& and & we have an appreciation of what our problems are...& STEVEN FRIEDMAN: I don\\'t think he was shocked - he may have appeared shocked but certainly in the discussions I had, the Treasury people expected this. I think he was perfectly entitled to challenge the decision because I think it was based on a particular set of phobias about what is happening in this country. Following from Adam\\'s point, one needs to remember that ratings agencies don\\'t get this stuff out of a bubble - they get speak to a lot of businesspeople. In effect what we are hearing from the ratings agencies is the negative business sentiment here being played back to us. Yes, you are absolutely right - he had to send the message he did, and it was an appropriate message in that sense because Adam\\'s points about inequality are well taken. If you compare the numbers we\\'ve heard and the hysteria we are seeing in the media, there isn\\'t much relation there. We are a country with major poverty and inequality problems - our problem is not wild government spending. I think having said that, the minister and the country\\'s problem is that he can stabilise the budget but dealing with the problems is not for the minister of finance. STV: A lot is put on two institutions in South Africa, the National Treasury and the Reserve Bank - where all they can do is work within the framework of the law. If other departments are not doing what they need to do, there isn\\'t much that they can do about it - are we putting too much pressure on them? KRISTER JANSE VAN RENSBURG: One often gets the feeling that Treasury is a pocket of excellence that government wants to put in the display window to show that everything is okay. As Adam said earlier it\\'s used maybe to a certain extent wrongly - or maybe rightly so to boost investor confidence. That\\'s one way we can show post-1994 through GEAR (growth, employment and redistribution) and the RDP (reconstruction and development) and all the interventions that we still have sound monetary policy and sound fiscal policy. I think the aim is to show Treasury is doing its job; however, whether they can steer political agendas is something else. STV: After the budget we heard & balanced& and & realistic& and & stable& which were calming words but is this enough to calm the nerves of those who may be looking at us today? KRISTER JANSE VAN RENSBURG: I think so. Balanced is a good word and it is very balanced but that can also be called & uninspiring& or even & boring& We could maybe do more. There is nothing exciting and what is worrying to us and our comrades in the labour movement is that maybe there is something coming in the budget speech next year... STV: What more do you expect? KRISTER JANSE VAN RENSBURG: We saw Minster Gordhan being very quiet about things like retirement reform, which is a burning issue at the moment, as well as the youth wage subsidy. Those things were brushed aside - we didn\\'t hear anything about that. National health insurance, as we all know, is causing concern around how that revenue is going to be generated to pay for it. STV: Another thing that wasn\\'t detailed was the infrastructure plan - we still don\\'t have detail about what role the private sector is going to play, are there going to be public private partnerships, and how it\\'s going to be funded given people are looking at South Africa when it comes to raising the debt... SHESHI KANIKI: Yes, I\\'d agree we\\'d have liked to see more about what\\'s coming. The minister intentionally took a very narrow view with what he was trying to communicate and the message for me was one of trying to say that Treasury has its eye on the ball as far as the fiscus is concerned in light of the downgrades and sociopolitical tensions we are currently experiencing. It was an extremely narrow view and I was also surprised to see no real mention of households and the fact that we are between a rock and a hard place and something along the lines of & this is the type of relief that will be required to keep the deficit at this level& so I thought Treasury had a very clear motive to allay fears around the credit rating and fiscal management. STV: A tweet said & at least he didn\\'t tell us to tighten our belts...& Treasury has a lot of balls to juggle.... Adam, it often feels as if Treasury, particularly around mini-budget time, is being pulled from all directions, juggling a lot of balls in the air, and that it\\'s always about what is the climate at the time the speech is being delivered which decides the tone. ADAM HABIB: This was the MTBPS so I didn\\'t expect more - especially given the context where they went out with a particular message. I think they were saying very clearly & we are not in a terminal crisis& and that Pravin Gordhan berated the ratings agencies, and he did that well. I think he said very clearly & you made your judgments on political variables - but you\\'re not particularly qualified to speak about those& and that they misunderstood the policy debates and how those play themselves out. I think that was effectively the message. What\\'s also important to note is that there are three or four state pillars that deal with economic policy and the purpose of Treasury has always been regarded by the constitution as managing the fiscal processes and it\\'s not meant to lead on economic policy. Often you will hear people grumbling that & Treasury is not leading on economic policy& but that\\'s not what the constitution expects it to do. It\\'s expected to look at the fiscal questions. What we need to see is that Treasury has done its part, now we need to see Economic Policy (sic) lead in terms of the social pact and we need the political elites to take that seriously. Yes, on the one hand you want to look at remuneration limits - but on the other hand you also have to contain expenditure on Nkandla homesteads and at the same time I want to see chief executives say they are willing to do this. I would like private-sector economists saying inequality is important to deal with - because as long as they don\\'t deal with this we are in serious trouble. Often the economists complain about Julius Malema but they sound like the tea party in the USA. We are not mainstream by global standards - they need to come on board in terms of what South Africa\\'s challenges are, and what we need to do at this historical moment. If we don\\'t do that, in 10 or 15 years this country will burn because we didn\\'t take the demands of poor people seriously. SHESHI KANIKI: As a private-sector economist the comment is well received - I can only speak for our particular context where we are trying to grapple with these particular issues much more holistically, creating shared value and championing the idea that we as the corporate sector cannot continue to exist almost in a bubble, that we need to start to see ourselves as a much more integral part of society as a whole and create value not just for shareholders but for the broader society. It\\'s an important comment and the issue of inequality that Adam raises is one of the fundamental challenges facing South Africa. In the long run business has to be involved in addressing that issue. STV: The minister spent some time on the NDP talking about the role that could play in unblocking some of the structural constraints South Africa faces, but as you know whenever that is brought up the opposition cries foul and says it\\'s never going to be implemented - but it has been signed off by Cabinet... STEVEN FRIEDMAN: The social pact is absolutely crucial and in that context I\\'m fascinated by the responses to the NDP - a lot of businesspeople have elevated the 440-page document, which has all sorts of proposals, and is a mixed bag and a basis for negotiation - they\\'ve elevated it into some kind of stone tablet where most of the people doing that haven\\'t read it. When the president goes to an agricultural summit and suggests one of the proposals in the NDP he gets accused of trying to destroy commercial agriculture. People have to be consistent. We are not going to get out of our economic problems in South Africa unless there are compromises between the major economic players but how can that happen if people trash every proposal that is made? If you don\\'t like a proposal, come up with alternatives. This environment we are in at the moment, where there are constant suggestions that government has to somehow produce a miracle - there is a lot wrong in government at the moment but unless businesspeople start treating the proposals on their merits, we are not going to make progress. One other point I want to make that we have to be concerned about is we could do quite a bit with poverty and inequality in South Africa with the current fiscal constraints we have, but then we have to look at how responsive government is to people and how effective it is at getting services to people. That is going to be a major focus in the period ahead because everything the minister said is entirely possible within the constraints of the budget if we have responsive government and they listen to poor people and citizens. STV: One thing the minister spoke about was strengthening municipal finances at the coal face of service delivery... KRISTER JANSE VAN RENSBURG: There are municipal problems - we saw the auditor-general\\'s report a while back - but it is very concerning they are not delivering. There are big problems with skills and people not having qualifications. The service delivery protests are not aimed at national government but at municipal government so we need to address that.\n",

      "Single-minded in purpose and in deed Much like platinum miners, old Land Rovers are one-trick ponies DESPITE hunting for it, I cannot locate the suggestion I read - perhaps it was on that perennially ephemeral medium, Twitter - that the government and business need to get together for a big fat lekgotla. I sometimes think these meetings are pointless. The government shouts at business; business blames the government - and between the barricades, the poor just try to avoid becoming collateral damage. Can you imagine, for example, being an Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) miner? As things stand, the company has delayed retrenching 14,000 workers after buckling under pressure from the African National Congress to take part in & detailed consultation& But it would appear the writing is on the wall. And, equally, can you imagine being First National Bank (FNB) CE Michael Jordaan? While I\\'m quite sure that whichever genius at FNB, or the bank\\'s agency, thought an ad hominem attack on individual ministers was a great way to advance the image of the bank has had an almighty Saturn V up the rectum, being hauled over the coals and in all likelihood having been threatened by a furious Gwede Mantashe was probably rather unpleasant. & TGIF,& Jordaan tweeted on Friday, tellingly. So in this fractious, febrile and unhappy time, perhaps simplistically, another government-business lekgotla will do no good, especially when they seem to focus on how business and the government can & work together& or, to borrow from Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza at the mining lekgotla in November, & intensifying social dialogue to build a common vision on jobs, growth, social stability and development& I think it\\'s a great idea, but the focus needs to change. I think a government-business lekgotla should not focus on what businesses and the state can do together, but rather on final agreement on who is responsible for what. Let\\'s re-establish the separation of powers and responsibilities and be held accountable only to those. And, absolutely crucially, let\\'s do this through the law. In terms of business, I would imagine a fair request would be that managers run their companies professionally and in accordance with the law, which, as I understand it, South African-based mining companies already do. It is desperately unreasonable to expect anything more, even if admirable corporate social responsibility programmes are the norm these days. If a company adheres to the law of the land, why should it face the wrath of political professionals? This isn\\'t just a South African problem. In the UK, Prime MinsterDavid Cameronhas attacked Starbucks because he believes it has not paid enough tax - such companies need, he said, & to wake up and smell the coffee& And yet it is very clear that Starbucks, like Lonmin or Amplats, has not committed fraud and in fact has not broken any law at all. If it\\'s not the law that companies need to follow, what, indeed, is there to guide them? It seems businesses are in the hugely prejudicial position of needing to read Mantashe\\'s mind. Who wrote this script? Ayn Rand? Obviously Starbucks needs to operate for the benefit of its shareholders. That\\'s its only mandate, the one thing on earth it exists to do. But what if Cameron decides, randomly and unfairly, to start flinging mud? What\\'s a miner to do? The bottom has fallen out of platinum, costs are spiralling, shareholders are worried - by all accounts the company needs to find efficiencies urgently. The opportunity cost of tying up capital in producing something nobody wants right now - platinum - is potentially vast. Investors know this. And so to the government. If the government could understand that miners have one skill - getting stuff out of the ground - it would really help. If it wants to uplift the poor, the state needs to enable that, to grease the infrastructure wheels. Instead of attempting to force miners to retrain as property managers and & beneficiators& why not help them do what they do best? When the government and unions can understand that jobs are not a right, but a cost, then perhaps they\\'ll see the value in pursuing growth. Perhaps, then, they might lay off with the supposedly developmental cosh with which they are setting about companies operating legally in this country. Old Land Rovers are much like miners: one-trick ponies. They don\\'t handle, they don\\'t accelerate or stop terribly cleverly, they don\\'t do luxury or efficiency or eco-what-what. What they do is work off-road, and this Christmas holiday my brother-in-law, Greg, and I discovered a tricky off-road trail through a coastal forest so thick and green it was like being in Andy Warhol\\'s head. My father has a rattly old Defender - a TD5. The TD5 was the last of the completely silly Defenders, the old five-speed model with doors that don\\'t really work, a useless air-conditioner and a motor so noisy above 100km/h that conversation is impossible. But boy, it works off-road. There\\'s a sense of inexorability, of the inevitability of getting there in a Defender. Faced with thick sand and a steep incline, a quick crunch of gears - low-range and diff-locked - and the old beast climbs up it without any trouble. Of course, Greg wanted to try out his new Toyota Fortuner, which did everything just as easily and, if we\\'re honest, with bags more comfort. But who cares? It\\'s a huge laugh to drive a car, any car, that exists because of a ruthless focus on what it is supposed to do. And that\\'s why the Defender has a flat windscreen (flat glass can be found in most remote spots, bespoke curved glass not so much); it\\'s why it has a ladder-frame with solid axles and coil springs (incredible articulation and clearance off-road); it\\'s why it is shaped like a box (you know where the end of the car is, finish and klaar); and it\\'s why the driver is crammed uncomfortably up against the door (you can get your head out and see where you\\'re placing your right-side wheels easily). And it\\'s so good at all of this that nobody is trying to force Land Rover to build a Formula One car. It\\'s not what they do. Our miners should be allowed to operate with a similar clarity of purpose. parkera@bdfm.co.za It\\'s a huge laugh to drive a car, any car, that exists because of a ruthless focus on what it is supposed to do OFF-ROAD: There\\'s nothing like the sense of inevitability in getting to your off-road destination in a Defender TD5, even though more modern off-road vehicles do it in greater comfort and style.\n",

      "Strike looms as municipal negotiations falter Political Editor MUNICIPAL workers\\' unions yesterday warned of a looming strike in the sector after talks on a collective agreement collapsed. Municipal workers are at the coal face of service delivery, with strikes in the sector generally characterised by uncollected refuse littering cities and towns. Year-long talks between the South African Local Government Association (Salga) on the one hand, and the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) and the Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (Imatu) on the other, deadlocked this week. The agreement in question was meant to centre on issues including conditions of service, dispute resolution, discipline and time off for shop stewards. Salga executive director Rio Nolutshungu said the talks could not proceed as the unions wanted to broaden the mandate of negotiations. The unions wanted the scope of the agreement to include companies linked to municipalities such as Pikitup and City Power. They further wanted municipalities to administer services provided by companies with which they made agreements, such as those offering short-term loans to employees. But Mr Nolutshungu said that would violate existing legislation and increase the administrative burden on municipalities. Union dealings with companies providing services to their members was not the business of municipalities. The employer was responsible only for deducting stop orders from union members for union fees. & They want us to grant them rights to include when they have a scheme initiated with a third party, they can operationalise that scheme from our side,& he said. Salga was hoping to have & one-on-one& discussions with unions outside the bargaining council in order to persuade them to return to the negotiating table. Samwu general secretary Walter Theledi said that Salga was negotiating in bad faith and had no intention of concluding a new agreement with the unions. The main collective agreement for the sector was signed in 2003. & The material conditions on the ground necessitated our submission on the improvement of conditions of service,& Mr Theledi said. & Our submission was responded to with arrogance from the employer body without any justification.& Salga had frustrated the talks by & refusing to make any concessions& when parties to a negotiation were expected & to give and take& Samwu declared a dispute after talks collapsed on Tuesday. The unions were canvassing the opinion of their members to determine whether to down tools. & Municipal workers may decide to embark on industrial action over this matter,& said Mr Theledi. Imatu deputy general secretary Craig Adams said negotiations had proved & exceptionally frustrating& for the trade union. & Imatu has gone to great length to motivate and justify all of our proposals, yet we are being met with unsubstantiated resistance.& Imatu was exploring its options. These might include referring the matter for arbitration. But Imatu had also not ruled out striking, Mr Adams said. Salga and both unions have been at odds over a long-standing wage curve deal. Salga had rejected a facilitator\\'s proposal on ending the lack of uniformity in the remuneration of municipal workers, Samwu said earlier this month. Unions want Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Richard Baloyi to intervene in the dispute with Salga.\n",

      "From South African pioneer to world beater The company prides itself on its ability to change and adapt, which has contributed to its durability over the past century and more THE Barloworld story is one of determination, endurance and integrity, a tale of a company that has remained true to its culture and values for 110 years through many challenges, changes, ups and downs, and numerous highlights. From humble beginnings selling woollen goods in Durban, Barloworld\\'s skilled, passionate and pioneering people have built a rich heritage that is encapsulated in doing business the & Barloworld way& \"One of the things that have allowed us to be around for 110 years is our ability to change and adapt,& says Barloworld CEO Clive Thomson. In 2007 Barloworld undertook a significant restructure that saw PPC and Coatings (Plascon Paints), two of its major subsidiaries, unbundled from the group as standalone listed entities and two other significant businesses were sold. The company repositioned from eight divisions to four and in the process refocused on its traditional core distribution businesses with an offering that includes integrated product support, rental and logistics solutions. The global financial crisis followed soon after the restructuring. Barloworld\\'s resilience through this period - and the uncertain times that followed - has proven the wisdom of this decision to focus on core capabilities. & Our philosophy in recent years has been articulated in terms of value-based management, which recognises the importance of driving value creation for all our stakeholders. These stakeholders include our shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and principals (in our case Caterpillar, Hyster, leading motor vehicle manufacturers and Avis, among others) as well as the broader communities in which we operate, and our environment,& Thomson explains. & Whether we are delivering unique customer solutions, forming long-term partnerships, engaging the societies we work in through our various transformation and CSI initiatives, satisfying our shareholders through our approach to financial returns and profitable growth interventions, or developing our employees, value creation remains the backbone of our business.& In 2010 the group set its bold Vision 2015³, which aims to deliver significant incremental value for all stakeholders through 2015. The company is making significant progress towards achieving this objective through its core divisions, Equipment, Handling, and Automotive & Logistics. The Equipment division sells and supports Caterpillar mining, earthmoving and power generation products, while Handling represents mainly Hyster and agricultural brands including Massey Ferguson. It also represents the Chinese-manufactured range of SEM earthmoving products. Automotive represents various motor vehicle manufacturers, together with fleet management and car rental services through the Avis brand, and integrated supply chain solutions through its Logistics arm. Six strategic focus areas, integrated customer solutions, people, empowerment and transformation, sustainable development, financial returns and profitable growth, supported by appropriate action plans and performance indicators, align purpose and ensure common priorities through the group. These focus areas are combined to drive the group\\'s success across its divisions, while identified strategic growth segments - mining, infrastructure, power, automotive, logistics and agriculture - provide an exciting platform for Barloworld\\'s continued growth into the future. Given the global leading brands that it represents and its geographic footprint across 26 countries and four continents, Barloworld is well positioned to prosper in these growth segments. & Our 2012 financial year was a successful year in which we pursued various strategic initiatives that positioned the business for growth and we continued the process of redeploying capital into higher return opportunities,& says Thomson. Barloworld acquired the Bucyrus distribution and support businesses from Caterpillar in southern Africa and Russia, providing the group with the most extensive range of surface and underground mining products in the industry. A number of niche acquisitions were made in the Automotive division, including Avis Coach Charter and a fuel management company. Toyota and Volkswagen dealerships were opened in Soweto. By integrating its Logistics business into the Automotive division, Barloworld was able to leverage synergies and drive profitable growth. The acquisition of a specialised chemical transporter, formation of a joint venture with Manline, and the purchase of the 25% minority in Logistics Africa positioned this business to continue on its aggressive growth path. In the Handling division, the US and UK handling businesses were sold to enable cash to be redeployed into higher returning opportunities and the agricultural business was expanded in Siberia, western Russia and Mozambique. The group never loses sight of the fact that its success is driven by people and, in line with this strategic focus area, devotes significant attention to attracting, developing and retaining the talented employees required to deliver its objectives. & It\\'s the people who make the company. You can have the best brands in the world; at the end of the day it is the people who drive the success. The people at the top set the tone and those at the coalface make things happen,& says Thomson. Barloworld\\'s people have developed a pioneering spirit that enables them to endure some of the harshest conditions as they go about their work. & For them it is part of creating something special. They become professional pioneers... it\\'s what inspires them,& Thomson points out. & It\\'s this \\'frontier\\' attitude coupled with strong values that has helped the company move into places as far flung as Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Magadan in the Russian Far East. The people who work in this organisation see the challenges as opportunities rather than as negatives.& This commitment has also resulted in Barloworld sharing a more than 85-year partnership with Caterpillar, the world\\'s leading earthmoving equipment manufacturer, as well as very long-term relationships with a number of its other key principals. Other central aspects of the group\\'s value creation activities are continuously building employee diversity as well as effective stakeholder engagement. It all began back when Ernest (Billy) Barlow found himself in South Africa during the Boer War of 1899-1902. After the war he borrowed £1,000 to found Thomas Barlow & Sons in Durban. In 1927 his son, Punch Barlow, went to the US and negotiated the rights to the Caterpillar dealership. Legend has it that Punch sold the first Cat tractor in South Africa after winning a bet that a tractor could plough faster than a span of oxen. Barloworld\\'s recognised leadership in skills development has its roots in the vision of Punch Barlow, a legendary leader who believed that Barlow\\'s, as the company became known, should have an educated, motivated, loyal workforce where people would be recognised. If not, the company would not earn their loyalty. That ethos became entrenched in Barlows and was carried on by subsequent leaders in the group. & Punch Barlow was interested in people and the way people developed.

      "Civil society Manners a good start in striving for \\'unity in diversity\\' MANNERS maketh the man,& an aphorism coined by William of Wykeham more than 600 years ago, is the motto of Winchester College and New College, Oxford, to this day. Recent events in the political and social discourse in SA, and in litigation of a public-interest nature, have brought the status of civility in our society to the fore. Any nation that strives to be united in its diversity, as ours aspires to do, and is aimed at creating circumstances in which the promotion of human dignity, the achievement of equality and the enjoyment of the various freedoms guaranteed in the Bill of Rights are goals, ought to invest heavily in its manners. & Minding p\\'s and q\\'s& as our mothers taught us to do, is the surest way to & healing the divisions of the past& as envisaged in the preamble to the constitution. Tolerance and respect ought to be the watchwords. It is therefore a welcome development that the Speaker of Parliament, Max Sisulu, has insisted on apologies from two MPs who set a poor example of mannerly conduct in their interactions with the leader of the opposition, Lindiwe Mazibuko, whose size and fashion sense were attacked in rather puerile ways. As for the unseemly spat between the South African Students\\' Congress and Julius Malema\\'s Economic Freedom Fighters, the less said the better. No less alarming is the unbridled response of the Higher Education Transformation Network to the decision of the Helen Suzman Foundation to seek clarity from the courts about the interpretation of the constitutional mandate of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). It came out with a statement & condemning and deploring& the application. The fact that the courts have already ruled that the conduct of the JSC is irrational seems to have escaped the attention of the network. Perhaps it has also not noticed that one of the JSC\\'s members has resigned in protest against his inability to persuade his colleagues of the wrong-headedness of their approach to the task of recommending judicial officers for appointment. Further, that the constitutional requirement that race and gender be taken into consideration during this delicate process has been elevated to the & be all and end all& criterion, also seems to have been misconstrued by the network. With all the zeal of the true believer, it has launched into an application to be admitted as a friend of the court somewhat prematurely, even before the JSC has decided whether it wishes to oppose an application that, on the face of it and in the circumstances sketched above, is both necessary and in the public interest. Very properly, the Helen Suzman Foundation has declined to consent to this intervention until such time as the network is able to show whether it has anything to add to assist the court in its deliberations. This it will not be able to do until it knows what the attitude of the JSC toward the application is, as it emerges from the opposing papers that are likely to be filed in court. One is left with the impression that the deploring and condemning is at best grandstanding, at worst a misguided attempt to bully the Helen Suzman Foundation. Its representative has expressed the hope that all interested parties will remain respectful of other parties so that & the status of civility in our democracy is strengthened& More disturbing than the goings on in Parliament and in the Helen Suzman Foundation litigation is the unseemly ridiculing of the Equal Education nongovernmental organisation by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga in a press release responding to its latest initiatives aimed at securing the promulgation of minimum norms and standards for infrastructure in schools. Equal Education has been trying patiently to engage with the minister for three years. In that time, it has had only two meetings with her, one of a rather preliminary nature and the other to settle the litigation on which it had to embark in order to stir the minister into setting the standards for infrastructure that are vital to hold to account those responsible for their provision. While it is widely appreciated and well understood that Motshekga is being dilatory in order to avoid giving civil society a rod with which to beat her back once she does set norms and standards for infrastructure, the fact remains that she settled the court case on the basis that they would all be in place by May 15. Now she wants another six months to do what she agreed to do last November. Her excuses for the delay do not stand up to objective scrutiny and, correctly so, the Eastern Cape High Court, in Grahamstown, has set a date for the urgent hearing of the renewed litigation over norms and standards that Equal Education thought it had settled last November. So Motshekga, unabashedly and shamelessly, has resorted to playing the race and patronisation cards against Equal Education. At first, Equal Education could not believe Motshekga had anything to do with the press release in which the following surprising words appear: & However, to suddenly see a group of white adults organising black African children with half-truths can only be opportunistic, patronising and simply dishonest, to say the least.& Equal Education gave Motshekga the opportunity to dissociate herself from the lack of civility (and accuracy) in the words quoted. She did no such thing. By way of following up, Equal Education has published a comprehensive rebuttal of the inaccuracies in the departmental press statement. A perusal of the affidavit filed in support of the pending court application in Grahamstown shows that Motshekga is going to have her work cut out for her if she is going to succeed in getting more time to do what she agreed to complete by May 15. Twenty broken promises made by or on behalf of Motshekga suggest that she, not Equal Education, is the problem. Seasoned observers of political interaction in SA agree that the playing of the race card is usually the last resort of scoundrels who have run out of better arguments. The & patronisation card& is played less frequently, but usually for the same reason - no other card is left to play. For a grass-roots organisation such as Equal Education to be on the receiving end of accusations of being patronising toward its own constituency must be particularly hurtful to those who have toiled long and hard in its ranks to achieve delivery of the right to basic education, which has been due to all, child and adult alike, since the dawn of democracy. Sisulu has given the uncivil MPs short shrift. The courts will maintain decorum in the Helen Suzman Foundation litigation. Will President Jacob Zuma have anything to say about the effect on nation-building and reconciliation of the words in Motshekga\\'s press release about Equal Education? We are in an election year. Temperatures at the political coal face are rising. Don\\'t expect decisive leadership on this one - the minister happens to be president of the African National Congress Women\\'s League; she is accordingly royal game and need not fear that her feathers will be ruffled by the leader of the Cabinet in which she serves, or is supposed to serve. The racism, dishonesty, inaccuracy and opportunism in the ministerial press release about Equal Education will all go unaddressed, and impunity will prevail. Unity in diversity will have to wait until after the elections. More\\'s the pity. & 8226;Hoffman is a director of the Institute for Accountability in Southern Africa. \\'Twenty broken promises made by Motshekga or on her behalf suggest she, not Equal Education, is the problem\\'\n",

      "Cosatu lacks unity to act against jobs incentive OBJECTIONS by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) to the draft Employment Tax Incentive Bill come as no surprise. The trade union\\'s opposition is as audible as its earlier incantation against the youth wage subsidy, first proposed by President Jacob Zuma in his 2010 state of the nation address. But does the federation, with its top leadership torn apart, have the capacity to successfully drive a campaign against the bill? It is unlikely. While the fate of suspended general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi appears on the surface to be at the centre of the divisions, it runs much deeper than that. Whether he stays or goes at this point is irrelevant. Mr Vavi is a mere casualty in the broader identity crisis facing SA\\'s largest labour federation. And in any case, he presided over many an un-won battle in the federation in recent years: think labour brokers. Cosatu in its present state cannot hold the line on decisions ratified by its top decision-making structure, the national congress. Nor can it stick to decisions taken by the central executive committee, the highest decision-making body between congresses. Cosatu\\'s national congress ratified its decision to oppose electronic tolling on Gauteng highways. Yet its Gauteng chapter was raked over the coals at a central executive committee meeting for its & obsession& with the e-tolling campaign. Cosatu in Gauteng was similarly chastised for protesting, at the opening of the legislature, against labour brokers, another congress decision. Further evidence of Cosatu\\'s flip-flopping over its own decisions is borne by a startling revelation reflected in the minutes of a meeting of its national office bearers. A facilitated process set in motion at a central executive committee meeting earlier this year to get to the root of the divisions in the federation is punted at every opportunity as the panacea to the present impasse. It has now emerged that the credibility of this facilitated process has been called into question - by the federation\\'s national office bearers, no less. Second deputy president Zingiswa Losi, according to the minutes, said some office bearers & had already lost confidence& with the process - led by seasoned negotiator Petrus Mashishi and respected labour lawyer Charles Nupen. Mass action in the recent period has been overtaken by internal politics. A massive protest held nationally last year against e-tolls and labour broking became more about Mr Vavi allowing then-African National Congress (ANC) Youth League president Julius Malema a platform to address workers. The crisis faced by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in the Rustenburg area was another issue where internal politics took centre stage, instead of the fate befalling the federation\\'s largest and most influential affiliate. Fellow affiliate the National Union of Metalworkers of SA was criticised for failing to provide support to the NUM in that instance. As loud and vociferous as its opposition to the bill may appear, Cosatu could end up, at best, delaying its implementation, particularly as the ANC appears bent on pushing it through. A statement from the party\\'s chief whip in Parliament, Sizani Stone, said: & We appeal to all stakeholders to support this progressive initiative, which we are confident Parliament will pass to ensure it comes into operation from January 2014.& With the youth vote up for grabs next year, addressing youth unemployment would be a priority for any political party. & Millions of young South Africans are hungry for workplace experience, for job opportunities and to build their future and the future of SA\\'s economy,& Mr Stone said. Cosatu campaigns are driven by its affiliates, who in many instances are divided themselves. Some affiliates have become entangled by what the ANC described as the & sins of incumbency& where leaders are largely in it for themselves. The campaign most of these unions would drive vigorously next year is to garner votes for the ANC, which they see as a vehicle to drive their own personal ambitions. The rest of their campaigns could all too easily fall by the wayside. marriann@bdfm.co.za TENSION: Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, left, Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini, right, and President Jacob Zuma.

      "\\'Stomach politics\\' prevails in Bekkersdal Trouble in West Rand hotspot runs deep, write A SPRAWLING & mansion& painted deep red and grey, adorned with steel pillars, a high wall and metal gates, stands in stark contrast to the squalor surrounding it - sewage, rubbish and tin shacks surround the home dubbed & Nkandla& by locals in Bekkersdal. The protest-ridden community turned up in their numbers at the polls yesterday, using their democratic right to change their lot in the impoverished West Rand town. Since September, Bekkersdal has seen & service delivery protests& but the problems plaguing this community run deep. & Politics of the stomach& nepotism and allegations of corruption against senior African National Congress (ANC) leaders are at the root of the protests. The situation is a stark reminder of the problems that are common in local government, the coal face of service delivery, across SA. The ANC won 66% of the vote in Westonaria in local government polls in 2011, followed by the Azanian People\\'s Organisation (Azapo) at 13%. The municipality received a qualified audit in 2011-12, and the auditor-general found intervention was required and expressed concern about its leadership. The & mansion& which a resident points out to the Business Day - asking that journalists walk some distance behind her for fear of reprisals - belongs to a leader of the ANC Youth League, Reggie Nkabinde, whose newfound wealth was amassed in mere months, say community members, describing him as a & tenderpreneur& A leader of the Socialist Party of Azania (Sopa), who wishes to remain anonymous, says Mr Nkabinde\\'s & Nkandla& is a slap in the face to the impoverished community in which it is located. The Sopa leader is aligned to the Greater Westonaria Concerned Residents\\' Association, who came together in a bid to have the local municipality dissolved due to maladministration. The association is a conglomerate of parties that put narrow loyalties aside in a bid to improve the plight of the community. It includes members of Azapo, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the Democratic Alliance and even some ANC members. At the end of September, after receiving a mandate from residents in public meetings, the association approached West Rand district mayor Mpho Nawa with demands, including that the Westonaria local municipality be dissolved and mayor Nonkoliso Tundzi fired; that services such as refuse removal and sewerage be improved; and housing be provided. But Mr Nawa told residents there was nothing he could do. A few days later he returned to the area with ANC volunteers to campaign for the party. It was the last straw for residents, who attacked the group with stones and rocks, and chased them out of the area. The tripartite alliance - the South African Communist Party, the ANC and the Congress of South African Trade Unions - stepped in and brokered an agreement with the residents, promising to investigate their demands. Sopa said a dossier containing allegations of corruption against local leaders was handed to the auditor-general for investigation. An ANC member of the residents\\' association, Sipho Mabasa, confirmed this. The dossier also included allegations of nepotism against Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane, during her tenure as housing MEC under the presidency of Thabo Mbeki, who launched a R1bn urban renewal programme in the area. An elderly resident who wished to remain anonymous said yesterday that he had attended many meetings held by the association. & They want to unearth the money issues ... there are many things these people are trying to unearth. My God, there is all the secrecy around the urban renewal. & Forget politics,& he says, & everyone knows politics ... it\\'s stomach politics now.& The community member says there are also Mozambicans living in the area who were party to a & jobs for sale& scheme. Many locals say & outsiders& mainly people from the Eastern Cape, find it easier to access jobs than residents who had lived in the area for generations. Sopa and Mr Mabasa say that while the investigations of corruption in the municipality and in the abandoned urban renewal project began in February, the community has not yet received any feedback. ANC branch electoral co-ordinator Lillian Mosothoane says voting went smoothly yesterday but the ANC, unlike other parties, had a hard time campaigning in the area. The & anti-ANC sentiment& deepened when Ms Mokonyane told residents who booed party officials last year that the ANC did not want their & dirty votes& Ms Mokonyane has apologised on a public platform but residents want her to apologise to them directly. Members of the ANC from the provincial government tried to visit the area but were also chased away. Municipal workers have not been able to clean due to the hostile environment. The situation deteriorated to such a degree that the municipality brought the Red Ants in to clean in February, a move that coincided with the final voter registration drive. It turned violent due to the presence of the red-clad & guards& who are more usually tasked with evictions. Ms Mosothoane says there was also an element of & tribalism& to the unrest, with complaints that municipal workers and even the mayor were not from the area. She hopes that after the election the situation will & calm down& She accuses ANC members of the residents association of being bitter because they failed to secure positions in the 2011 polls. Mr Mabasa says the municipal corruption is & denting the image& of the party. & We don\\'t want to encourage criminals inside the ANC ... the ANC delayed and failed the community but when it comes to elections they are here,& he says, wearing a party beret and T-shirt. & I can\\'t be a member of the ANC unless I am a member of the community first.& Despite his deep concerns, he voted for the ANC and encouraged others to do so too. Sopa has thrown its lot in with the EFF, expected to displace Azapo. Mr Mabaso says the battle will continue after the election. & It is not over ... we will make sure our demands are met or we will take to the streets.& marriann@bdfm.co.za A dossier of allegations of corruption against local leaders was handed to the auditor-general A resident says Mr Nkabinde\\'s \\'Nkandla\\' is a slap in the face to the impoverished community\n",

      "Samwu probe \\'found no misappropriated funds\\' Political Correspondent AN INTERNAL investigation found no evidence that millions of rand had been misappropriated from South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) funds, union leaders said yesterday. Samwu, whose members are at the coal face of service delivery, is known for its vocal opposition to local government corruption. However, its office bearers have faced allegations in recent weeks, including over their lifestyles, while accusations that millions of rand has gone missing from union coffers date back to its 2012 congress. Amid these allegations, Samwu is to press ahead with reining in rebellious provincial leaders, as divisions threaten to split the union. Dozens of Samwu provincial leaders and shop stewards have been suspended or expelled in recent months, in a move some have said is a purge of those asking questions about union finances. Samwu\\'s national leaders in turn yesterday ascribed the allegation of a purge to disgruntled former members trying to destabilise the union. At a media briefing yesterday, Samwu\\'s national officer bearers announced the outcomes of a union probe of numerous allegations levelled at the executive. They said that although a task team had uncovered some inconsistency in financial practices, all accusations of maladministration, malpractice or corruption at the union were baseless. Samwu Limpopo secretary Simon Mathe, who was part of the task team, said yesterday the probe had been narrowed to investigate six allegations, & in the midst of bombardments whose sole purpose was to discredit and assassinate the task team members\\' character& An accusation that R80m was unaccounted for in 2012 was found to be baseless, while access to documentation by the accusers had raised questions over their financial literacy, he said. The union\\'s deputy general secretary, Moses Miya, said the task team\\'s report would now be taken to local structures. Mr Miya urged members to defend the union, which he said was & being bombarded with negativity and a campaign led by disgruntled people whose sole purpose is to sow divisions within the union& Provincial office bearers in the Western Cape, Mpumalanga and the North West had been or would be suspended by the end of this week, he said. The suspensions follow those provinces\\' continued support for other suspended or expelled officials and shop stewards. Contacted for comment, expelled former North West chairman Sello Selepe, spokesman for the Save our Samwu grouping, said yesterday that disgruntled Samwu members would continue a national campaign seeking a forensic audit of the union\\'s finances. He denied that there was an attempt to destroy Samwu. & We are trying to save it,& he said. Congress of South African Trade Unions president Sdumo Dlamini said yesterday that the federation had received written complaints from suspended Samwu members, and had formulated an intervention after meeting with the union\\'s national office bearers. gernetzkyk@bdfm.co.za\n",

      "A welcome investigation THE most surprising aspect of the Competition Commission\\'s announcement that it is investigating allegations of price-fixing, market division and collusive tendering among automotive component suppliers is that the apparent victims - motor manufacturers - seem to have been taken by surprise. It is no secret that SA was among the most concentrated economies in the world when it emerged from the apartheid era, and there have been enough revelations of widespread anticompetitive behaviour over the past two decades for the odds to be relatively high of the automotive sector being among those afflicted with the disease. Many of the practices that are defined as anticompetitive in terms of the Competition Act are so embedded in SA\\'s corporate culture that it has taken considerable effort to convince companies - especially the middle managers who are at the proverbial coal face - that the way they have always done business is morally wrong and now illegal. But that is no excuse. It is incumbent on CEOs and company boards to ensure their subordinates are both informed and compliant with the law. International research indicates that collusive behaviour inflates prices in an economy by 10%-25% and raises barriers to entry for new and small businesses. In the South African context, with the National Development Plan and government policy aimed at encouraging the development of small, medium and micro enterprises as a means of growing the economy and creating jobs, collusion is especially unwelcome. And when you factor in the government\\'s attempts to foster black economic empowerment, business practices that favour the incumbents at the expense of newcomers can expect short thrift. This was apparent with respect to the Department of Economic Development\\'s response to collusion by construction companies in their bids for the multibillion-rand Soccer World Cup stadium contracts, when attempts to justify anticompetitive behaviour on the basis that the work had to be shared out to ensure there was sufficient capacity and to meet tight deadlines did not get much sympathy. Similarly, the investigation that is under way into a cartel of about 70 furniture removal companies that allegedly agreed among themselves who would submit the lowest tenders to win contracts, is unlikely to be put off by claims that it is often government officials that request phony bids and encourage collusion so they can work with a favoured supplier. In the automotive industry, though details are still sketchy, it appears that the local investigation is a spin-off from similar probes that have taken place in the US, Europe and Asia, and that almost all of the 82 component manufacturers in question are based offshore. What is known is that the investigation was initiated when one of the companies that was part of a cartel applied for leniency from prosecution in exchange for information implicating others. US, European and some Asian competition authorities co-operated in their investigations, and the Competition Commission is expected to seek similar assistance as it tries to establish the extent of the harm caused in SA by the alleged price-fixing, market division and collusion. It is likely that emphasis will be placed on establishing whether collusion stifled the development of the domestic parts industry, which has struggled to compete with imports and remains relatively underdeveloped. With the exception of catalytic converters, it is rare for more than one domestic component manufacturer to produce the same part, largely because of the volumes required to achieve economies of scale. Proving that collusion by offshore companies has harmed local competitors will therefore not be easy without input from foreign authorities and admissions by suppliers seeking leniency.\n",

      "Economic dysfunction is undermining Nigeria\\'s progress ONE of the biggest complaints about Nigeria from foreign companies is how unnecessarily difficult it is to do business there. The government is not short of grand plans to diversify its economy and politically expedient quick wins but it is less exercised with dealing with the underlying factors that undermine economic development and diversification. Many of its policies have focused on stimulating local manufacturing to reduce the country\\'s huge import bills. Over the years it has imposed import bans, slapped high tariffs on a range of goods and tried to pick winners to boost industrial development. But it has failed to simultaneously address the dysfunction that makes it so challenging to operate businesses in Nigeria. These include a range of illegal business practices that have developed over the years to the extent they have now become part of the fabric of the economy, despite their corrosive and costly effect on development. An example is smuggling, an issue that may derail the government\\'s latest attempt at industrialisation - building a domestic car manufacturing industry. It has offered international manufacturers a range of incentives to invest. They include revised tariffs on imported used cars, which comprise the majority of vehicles in Nigeria, a country that has tried, and failed, to build a sustainable car industry. Next month, the tariff on used cars, raised to 35% in mid-2014, will be hiked to 70%. Making used cars expensive, aims to encourage people to buy locally assembled and manufactured cars. This is the intention. But the fact is that the smuggling of cars from neighbouring Benin is getting worse. More than 10,000 vehicles a week cross the border into Nigeria from Benin, some legally imported this way to avoid the congested and inefficient port in Lagos, but many smuggled in. The Nigerian ports authority says vehicle imports through Lagos port in January last year, just months after the new car policy was announced, was 27,000 units. In January this year, this had dropped to 8,000 units. This is what the government intended. But in the first month of this year, there was also a 50% rise in vehicle imports into Benin - a red light for manufacturers in Nigeria. The issue was discussed at a conference in Johannesburg last week, where an executive of Nissan, which is producing cars in Nigeria, outlined some of the challenges the company faces there. One of them is smuggled imports, which may threaten the success of their investment. Another is the port in Lagos, through which it imports its semi-knocked-down kits for assembly. It can take months to get the kits out of the port. Political will at the top has not filtered down to the coal face where customs officials, government agencies and other actors hold sway. It is not just cars that are smuggled into Nigeria. South African retailers in Nigeria cannot sell many types of imported shoes because they are on a list of banned imports - but they are freely available on the streets. Illegal imports of rice amount to 8,000 bags a year, undermining efforts to build local rice production. There are many other examples. It is not just business and investors that are affected. The government itself is losing billions in import revenues. Nigeria\\'s economic dysfunction is fuelled both by powerful vested interests which benefit from the status quo and by millions of people who earn incomes from & parallel& economic activities. All of these make it difficult and expensive to do business in the country. The government seems to rely on special deals, import tariff exceptions and incentives to attract investors, rather than making the environment more investor friendly for everyone. Tackling the entrenched economic dysfunction - difficult, but not impossible with the right political will - is essential for the country to transform. & 8226;Games is CEO of African business advisory Africa @ Work.\n",

      "EDITORIAL COMMENT. Foolish to ignore effect of visa rules TOURISM Minister Derek Hanekom\\'s announcement to Parliament, that a survey is to be conducted to gauge the effect of the new visa regulations on the tourism industry, is a good example of what is wrong with the government\\'s understanding of how a meaningful democracy works. The potential loss of 270,000 foreign tourists and 21,000 tourism-related jobs may well be an & unintended consequence& of the onerous requirements that have been put in place by the Department of Home Affairs, as Mr Hanekom warned. But they are certainly not an unforeseen consequence. Numerous warnings were sounded - both when the measures were proposed and throughout the process of their implementation - by industry players who understand the sector and were concerned that making foreign visitors jump through too many unnecessary hoops would persuade them to go elsewhere for their holidays. The issue has been debated ad nauseam in the media, and Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has been petitioned directly by worried representatives of the travel and accommodation sectors. Nobody in the government can possibly claim to have been unaware of the risks associated with making it more difficult for foreign visitors to obtain South African visas. The fact that these consequences were foreseen, but ignored, makes matters immeasurably worse than if they had been merely & unintended& In theory, the process of generating new legislation or updating regulations incorporates a number of measures intended to avoid the creation of bad law. In cases where there could be adverse economic consequences, this process should involve careful assessment of the economic effect of the regulations or law under consideration. It is now common cause that this is almost never done. The outcome is a policy and legislative debate that is so fractured it can only produce a bad decision or result in litigation. It does not always have to be this way. In addition to the attentions of opposing political parties in Parliament, draft legislation prepared by state employees, expert consultants and lawyers is picked over by MPs in specialised portfolio committees, and the refined product is published for comment by the public and industry. In practice, these requirements are treated as a box-ticking exercise, with the input of anyone who is not considered & on side& routinely ignored. It is profoundly disappointing that Mr Gigaba has not even attempted to provide a wider context of child trafficking in SA, which would be useful since most of it is internal. The introduction of regulations meant to fight a small minority of cases but that have wider economic implications, demonstrates the dangers of an executive-minded process. If the tourism industry\\'s worst fears are realised and thousands of jobs are lost, Mr Gigaba is unlikely to be hauled over the coals by Parliament, although oversight of the executive is one of its main roles in terms of the Constitution. Nor has the voting public shown much inclination in the past to punish the governing party at the polls when it forgets how it came to power. Independent regulatory impact assessments should be a routine part of the law-making process so there\\'s no need for surveys to be conducted after the fact to assess the damage that may or will be done. Had this been done the debate within Cabinet and in Parliament would have been better informed and more in line with the interests of the country. Even though the regulations are now in force, the opportunity still exists for a review to produce an outcome that addresses concerns about crime and helps tourism.\n",

      "Squabbling unions leave workers vulnerable PENDING retrenchments in the private sector have left thousands of workers at risk, with organised labour at its weakest since 1994. The business of unionism and the Department of Labour, which is meant to regulate the sector, find themselves in a state of paralysis through infighting at a time when workers need representation and labour stability is key to growing a weak economy. In 2012, the headquarters of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) was thrust into a panic when most of its affiliates were threatened with deregistration for failing to comply with the Labour Relations Act. The matter was resolved when unions submitted outstanding information. Three years later, Cosatu affiliates are faced with another bubbling crisis: factional battles that threaten to derail them from implementing their core mandate - to protect workers\\' interests. The Chemical, Paper, Print, Wood and Allied Workers Union (Ceppwawu), which represents about 66,000 workers, is on the brink of being placed under administration in the midst of a dirty factional fight that has spilt over into the Department of Labour. Labour registrar Johan Crouse was removed from his post for trying to place Ceppwawu under administration without consulting Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant. Although Ceppwawu is a Cosatu affiliate, it was the country\\'s two other labour federations - the Federation of Unions of SA and the National Council of Trade Unions - that expressed their concern to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa about the treatment meted out to the registrar. In the gold and coal sectors, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has been locked in tense wage talks, but its general secretary, David Sipunzi, has come under fire from within its ranks after he voted against the adoption of credentials at Cosatu\\'s special national congress last month. Insiders are contemplating disciplinary action against him as he is said to have gone against a mandated union position. Not to be outdone, the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) has become entangled in the Passenger Rail Agency of SA\\'s (Prasa\\'s) boardroom brawl and come out as a staunch backer of CEO Lucky Montana. Mr Montana was given his marching orders last month following a public falling out with chairman Popo Molefe. Corruption allegations doing the rounds between Prasa and Satawu\\'s leadership saw the union split in 2012 and spawned the formation of its rival, the National Transport Movement. In the time since, the new union has dethroned Satawu as the majority union at South African Airways. The need for strong unions in the face of looming job cuts has been underlined by the recent ruling in the Labour Court in Johannesburg halting retrenchments at Telkom because of the company\\'s failure to follow due process. The state of affairs that led to Mineral Resources Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi\\'s withdrawal of Glencore Optimum\\'s mining licence is a further example of the perils of failing to follow due process during retrenchments, although he has conditionally lifted the suspension. The minister spent most of last week in crisis talks with mine bosses about retrenchments. The NUM expects up to 11,000 jobs could be lost in mining and has threatened to go on strike should this happen. While the current economic climate demands that unions remain on top of their game, palace politics continue to dominate in the upper echelons at the expense of the thousands of men and women at the coalface. marriann@bdfm.co.za (This is) at a time when workers need representation and labour stability is key to growing a weak economy AT RISK: Satawu members march to the Union Buildings last month demanding that fired Prasa CEO Lucky Montana be reinstated.

      "Mashaba edges closer to exit after being hauled over coals EPHRAIM & Shakes& Mashaba has edged closer to a Bafana Bafana exit after he was hauled over the coals by unimpressed members of the South African Football Association\\'s (Safa\\'s) technical committee on Wednesday. Mashaba was put through the wringer and asked to explain himself after Bafana\\'s failure to qualify for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. Some members of the committee went as far as suggesting that the embattled mentor should do the honourable thing and fall on his sword after an incident-riddled qualifying campaign that fizzled out with a disappointing 1-1 draw against minnows Mauritania two weeks ago. A committee member told Business Day that they did not hold back in the meeting chaired by Anastasia Tsichlas and Abel Rakoma and the grilling lasted almost the whole day. That the national team could only manage a third-place finish behind the 104th-ranked Mauritania in the qualifiers - the other teams in the group were Cameroon and Gambia - has upset many at Safa House. Mashaba was asked to explain how he arrived at the controversial selections that have been a hallmark of his regime over the past few months. The committee was particularly interested in the criteria he used to select players for the national team. He was also asked to explain why he has continued to snub several Europe-based players who could have helped Bafana during the qualifying campaign. The continued omission of players such as Kamohelo Mokotjo, Kermit Erasmus and Ayanda Patosi from Bafana did not go down very well with the committee. The committee member told Business Day that Mashaba defended himself and claimed the lack of a clinical South African-born finisher was the reason Bafana failed to qualify for Gabon. The beleaguered Bafana coach argued the best attacking talent in the Premier Soccer League hail from other countries and this contributed to his failure to qualify. He also bemoaned the lack of time to prepare the national team for international matches. But the committee members were far from convinced and they will forward their recommendations to the Safa executive committee and the matter will be on the agenda at the meeting on September 24. The Bafana technical committee members are mindful of the conundrum that Safa faces in deciding Mashaba\\'s future. Bafana have a 2018 World Cup qualifier against Burkina Faso in Ouagadougou on October 8. This tricky encounter will be followed by a challenging qualifier against Senegal to be played at an as yet unannounced South African venue on November 12. Do they show Mashaba the door in the coming days and then appoint a caretaker or a new coach who will have very little time to prepare the team before next month\\'s World Cup qualifiers? Or do they take a risk and allow Mashaba to continue in the job in the hope that the coach will get his act together before the two games? The committee members are toying with the idea of giving Mashaba an ultimatum, and should he fail to get four points from the two games against Burkina Faso and Senegal his dismissal will be a mere formality. Members of the Safa executive committee are also upset and there is a strong possibility that they will ask Mashaba to leave regardless what the technical committee recommends. TMG Digital.

      "Eswatini says it is not responsible for collapse of troika summit No reason given for cancellation The Eswatini government has slammed suggestions by SA officials that King Mswati III was to blame for a second high-level summit to discuss the situation in that kingdom being called off. The Southern African Development Community\\'s (Sadc) troika meeting, headed by President Cyril Ramaphosa, was supposed to take place today and include the king as well as Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi and Namibian President Hage Geingob. The cancellation of the summit and the tone of the response by the Eswatini government suggests that the region is further away from bringing together the different parties for an Eswatini national dialogue than it was before the violence there in June last year which resulted in a large number of deaths and injuries. No official reason for the cancellation of the summit was offered, but SA officials said it was because Mswati was unable to attend in person and because of the importance of the meeting, his Sadc counterparts wanted him to be there. Eswatini government spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo, however, indicated in a diplomatic note dated July 12 \"that the Kingdom of Eswatini was going to participate in the summit on a virtual platform\". Subsequently the department of international relations sent an email to the Eswatini high commission with a virtual link and password for the summit. Nxumalo said the delegation from Eswatini at the preceding meeting by the ministerial committee of the Sadc organ on politics, defence and security co-operation in Pretoria was informed on Tuesday that the meeting was being cancelled, but no reasons were given. \"This was a completely unanticipated turn of events,\" Nxumalo said. \"The Kingdom of Eswatini has, at all times, been ready to attend the summit.\" The previous summit in April was also cancelled at the last minute, and again Eswatini was blamed. The national political dialogue, which Mswati had agreed to last year, was supposed to have been discussed at the summit, but Eswatini officials insisted that Sadc should first have allowed Eswatini to have engagements about the document that it wants to discuss at the summit. It is believed, however, that Eswatini had a deadline of February 28 to submit its response to the document, a draft terms of reference resulting from a fact-finding mission led by Jeff Radebe and appointed by Ramaphosa as Sadc security organ chairperson. Eswatini officials say there is no working document to discuss and therefore there could not be a summit. They also believe that the Sadc organ on politics, defence and security co-operation, which consists of three member states, had no good reason under Sadc rules to intervene in Eswatini and that it should be mandated by the summit next month, attended by all member states, before it can establish a national dialogue in Eswatini. \"We feel like naughty children being hauled over the coals,\" an official complained. Opposition sources say the summit was cancelled because Mswati had been made aware that exiled opponents of the king were planning protests in Pretoria where the summit was due to have taken place. Troika talks: King Mswati III of Eswatini was due to attend the Sadc troika meeting along with President Cyril Ramaphosa and the presidents of Botswana and Namibia. Veli NhlapoSowetan\n",

      "Sub-Saharan Africa has become the \"new epicentre\" of violent Islamist terrorism, according to a report released earlier in 2023 by the UN Development Programme. This has dragged a reluctant SA into the war against terror, especially with its deployment of an SA National Defence Force combat team to the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) Mission in Mozambique, where it is fighting an insurgency by Islamic State Mozambique and the Islamic State-aligned Ahlu Sunna Wal Jamaah. This intervention has reportedly met with some success, but also with allegations of war crimes involving the unceremonious burning of what appeared to be enemy bodies in a bonfire. This all appears rather ironic, given SAâ(EURO)(TM)s historical hostility to foreign interventionism in the global war on terror. Former president Nelson Mandela rebuked US president George W Bush over the 2003 war in Iraq, saying, \"They just want the oil.\" At the time, the governing ANC played down the threat of jihadi terrorism in Africa, saying \"US efforts to indoctrinate Africa with fears of Islamic terrorism, [are] to establish a US military mission in every African country, to control media, finances, religions and politicians.\" It is also ironic in the light of the governmentâ(EURO)(TM)s recent, implicitly partisan, response to the violation of a two-year ceasefire by Hamas, which governs Gaza, when it launched inhumane attacks against innocent civilians, including women and children, in Israel on October 7. The department of international relations &amp; co-operation did not condemn these attacks, or even name Hamas, but merely expressed \"grave concern\" over the \"devastating escalation\", for which it blamed Israel. Only once, in passing, did the government describe the original Hamas attacks as \"abhorrent\", and then only to draw an equivalence with the alleged Israeli \"attack\" on Al-Ahli Hospital. Rejected right The department claimed 500 people were killed and 1,000 injured in this \"attack\", when in fact the death toll was greatly exaggerated by Hamas and the \"attack\" turned out to involve a misdirected rocket fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another extremist terror group in Gaza. In calling for the immediate cessation of violence, the department rejected the right of Israel to use force to respond to a murderous invasion, or even to free its hostages. It followed that up with a call to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, in which international relations &amp; co-operation minister Naledi Pandor expressed SAâ(EURO)(TM)s \"solidarity and support for the people of Palestine\". Soon after, Pandor embarked on a diplomatic visit to Iran, which is widely considered a material supporter of jihadi terror groups worldwide, including Hamas. After this visit SA called for \"the international community to hold Israel accountable for breaches of international law\", as it pertains to civilian casualties in Gaza. In particular, the department called for Israel to be \"held accountable for war crimes, crimes against humanity and â(EURO)¦ the crime of genocide\". The department further scolded Israel, hauled the Israeli ambassador over the coals, and condemned more Israeli military actions, before referring \"the situation in Palestine\" to the International Criminal Court (ICC), with \"like-minded states\" Bangladesh, Bolivia, Venezuela, Comoros and Djibouti. It did not indicate who exactly is to be accused of \"war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide\" in The Hague, but it has never accused Hamas of these things. From the start, the best alternative to an Israeli military response to Hamas that the SA government could muster was a set of naively idealistic bromides on \"talks\" leading to a \"lasting peace\" and \"two-state solution\", objectives Israel has pursued but Palestinians have rejected violently for 75 years. Took sides Hamas shares many tenets in its charter, strategy, tactics, recruitment methods and terror against civilians with other jihadi groups, including the Islamic State groups that are proliferating throughout Africa. This exposes SAâ(EURO)(TM)s conflicted stance towards Islamist extremism. It is, of course, perfectly legitimate to criticise Israelâ(EURO)(TM)s conduct of the war and express grave concern about the humanitarian consequences, but by neglecting to condemn the prima facie war crime that provoked it, SA took sides. It also exposed its own hypocrisy, since it has been largely silent on the humanitarian consequences of Russiaâ(EURO)(TM)s invasion of Ukraine, and bent over backwards to avoid having to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was on an actual ICC arrest warrant for war crimes. The department of international relations &amp; co-operation has therefore implicitly aligned the country with the jihadist government of Gaza in its war against what Hamas and the SA government consider to be the illegitimate, \"settler colonialist\", \"apartheid state\" of Israel. It is simultaneously at war with jihadi insurgents in Mozambique. And it has an Islamic extremism problem at home going back to the 1990s, when People Against Gangsterism and Drugs morphed from a grassroots antigangster group into a violent vigilante group, influenced by radical Islam. It bombed government targets, synagogues, gay clubs and restaurants, which the group associated with Western decadence. According to a 2021 report by the Hudson Institute, a National Intelligence Agency report in 1998 identified the presence of Hamas delegates and affiliated individuals in SA. It documented their fundraising efforts and recorded their attendance at conferences near Pretoria also attended by members of Islamist militant groups such as the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Algerian Islamic Salvation Front, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah. This was the start of many disclosures, some involving arrests, of Islamic extremists operating in, or from SA, and SA citizens leaving to join jihadi terror groups in Africa and the Middle East. SA continues to be a hotbed of terrorist activity. Analysts and counterterrorism experts have said the country is a \"nerve centre for jihadist financing in Africa\", comprising an extensive network of \"charity\" and \"religious\" nongovernmental organisations. This led to US sanctions being levied against several South Africans, and the greylisting of the countryâ(EURO)(TM)s financial system by the Financial Action Task Force, a Paris-based watchdog combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The alarming extent of SAâ(EURO)(TM)s problem with Islamic extremism and jihadi financing is well documented and points to decades of complacency, erosion of intelligence and prosecuting capabilities and lack of understanding of the nature of violent extremism and the threats it poses. To even begin to address these issues, the government must establish clarity on its position vis-Ã\\xa0-vis jihadism. It fights Islamic extremism with one hand and supports it with the other when it suits its parochial ideological prejudices. Such inconsistency cannot produce an effective antiterrorism strategy.

      "We have been here before. The third major public service strike since 1994 is upon us. During the first major public service strike since democracy, in 1999, trade unions suffered a significant defeat with government\\'s unilateral implementation of wages. But in 2007, public service unions turned the tables on government, conducting an unprecedented strike and building an unlikely coalition with departments responsible for frontline service delivery. This resulted in the introduction of occupational specific dispensations (OSDs) that put new occupational classifications, promotions and grading systems in place. In both 1999 and 2007, there was the promise that the crises occasioned by national strikes would create the opportunity for long-run reforms in the public service. Sadly, in both instances this has not been the case. Will it, however, be \"third time lucky\" after this strike - with a better deal both for transforming service delivery as well as increasing employment in the public service? The concept of using collective bargaining for wider ends is commonplace in labour relations. In South Africa, the historic strikes in the mining sector and the introduction of skills development in the metal sector\\'s bargaining are widely regarded as examples of meeting wider ends. The public service would thus be a very apt candidate for conducting what is called \"transformative bargaining\". The concept, which has survived various iterations over the years, implies a two-fold commitment to bargaining from parties. First, that negotiating parties share a common commitment to transform public services through social dialogue. With the majority of public service unions in alliance with the ANC, and a stronger relationship between Cosatu and the Independent Labour Caucus at a political level, there have been strong prospects for developing a shared vision. Even the ideological stances and policy approaches of parties are not a major barrier to effective social dialogue, despite heated disagreements on privatisation. Second, that policy choices require leadership. Increasing employment in the public service is an important example of implementing a difficult policy choice. In the current dispute, government has argued that it has no additional funds to increase both salaries and employment at the same time. Militancy The position of government thus presents a stark set of choices, which is exactly what spurs militancy in the public service. Yet, there are well-developed proposals in the public domain that provide a range of options to introduce reforms that support long-run and service delivery oriented \"employment creation\" in the public service, while also providing salary increases. For example, government could introduce a lower level of jobs to ease the burden on professionals in the public sector, while at same time creating employment for a new generation of currently unemployed people. This could include increasing the number of teaching assistants and clerical support in schools to free up teachers to concentrate on teaching, while support staff deal with administration and other functions. This new category of workers, while earning entry-level salaries, could use this opportunity to gain much-needed work experience as well improve their qualifications. The proposals would ask of trade unions to factor in \"employment creation\" in developing their negotiations strategy. Importantly, the proposals are not small, with some going as far as proposing the creation of a quarter of a million new jobs within five years, and with costs requiring only moderate changes to baseline estimates. These proposals ultimately ask our society to meet both the objectives of providing workers a living wage while at the same time increasing employment, especially for young workers. Yet, government has not tabled any of these proposals during this salary round. Had it done so, the effect on bargaining would be nothing short of groundbreaking, shifting from haggling over percentages to debating and costing a developmental role for the government and public service unions. This approach promises a great deal: a labour-absorbing public service, better salaries, improved performance, less corruption and a professional public service. Why then have we not moved in this direction? In the parlance of negotiators in the public service, it has to do with \"cowboy bargaining\". By this it is meant that both parties adopt extremely strident and unrealistic initial positions, which not only sets in motion an adversarial stance, but more importantly lacks a wider policy framework. For government, this reflects the absence of leadership in developing policies to refocus bargaining on a developmental agenda. Doing this would require that government carefully unpacks a long-term reform programme in the public service, outside of the collective bargaining process. In some senses, it may replicate the processes developed after the democratic breakthrough that integrated the apartheid public service, and sought to bring about the reorientation of the public service to a development mandate. The entire policy package that served us in making the transition towards an integrated and democratic public service is now in need of urgent review to ensure that public services play a developmental role by widening opportunities and equalising outcomes, especially for the poor. Sadly, government has much to do to reach this ideal. The lack of a coherent message from government was demonstrated with the introduction of the OSD. The OSD provides for much-needed reviews of salary scales, provides career paths that keep excellent public servants at the coal face, and introduces internships as part of a major shake-up of public service employment. The process of the OSD was driven by service delivery departments, especially the health and education departments. The process led to a much-needed review of teachers\\' and nurses\\' salaries as well as other smaller sectors. These agreements were reached at the sector level bargaining chambers that focus on health, education and safety and security. The review and subsequent agreements had financial implications, while government signed salary agreements that also had fiscal costs. However, the combination of decisions at a sector level on OSD and those at the central bargaining level on salaries, were not co-ordinated. This led to the current budget position, with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan pointing out the hard reality of future affordability of high salary increases. Yet, at a deeper level, it also indicates significant policy incoherence in government, between demands at a sector level with those at the central level. This is not to suggest incompetence by government negotiators, but rather that policy contradictions were not ironed out nor were careful policy choices made at the cabinet level. During this bargaining round, government\\'s strategy has been confusing and misleading. The government was reluctant to admit early on that there was a dispute, keeping unions\\' hopes alive by continuously asking for more time. Yet, when strike action was initiated, it moved quickly to finalise its offer. The trade unions themselves need to be more introspective. While the salary demands from unions are not excessive, they need to be viewed against salary adjustments due to the OSD. Having a three-year retrospective perspective on salaries could have provided the basis for arriving at a settlement. Surprisingly, this pragmatic concession has a precedent after the 2007 strike. Despite the strong mobilisation, unions pushed for an increase slightly above inflation to accommodate future adjustments in the OSD. But with the government moving quickly towards unilateral implementation in the current strike, the prospects for a pragmatic resolution have receded. However, even under these conditions, trade unions need to exercise their power to advance a broader reform process in the public service. Ironically, both parties have tried to refocus bargaining through participating in the Public Service Summit. They have also engaged in a series of social dialogue processes guided by ideals of \"mutual gains bargaining\". These important initial steps should not be discounted for future public policy. However, neither government nor the unions can point towards tangible results from these processes. In the cut-and-thrust of salary negotiations, the tangible nature of agreements matters. The worrying factor is that earlier progress in the areas of performance and resourcing the public service might be undone during this acrimonious salary round. The reality is that without reaching these wider agreements quickly, we can anticipate the fourth major public service strike sooner rather than later. Descending into an adversarial bargaining stance over a longer period of time would set back the reform process in the public service at precisely the moment when significant improvements are needed. Reaching this wider agreement requires a commitment to building the public service to meet the developmental challenges that we face. For these reasons, a speedy resolution to the public service strike must be found, while strengthening social dialogue processes. Sadly, for now it seems that the cowboys are in charge, and, yes, we have been here before. l Hassen is an independent researcher and public policy analyst.

      "THE ANC\\'s most powerful province, KwaZulu-Natal, wants the party to officially bar members from singing songs - or wearing any party paraphernalia - which celebrates any living member of the organisation, except for its sitting president. KwaZulu-Natal ANC structures want those guilty of this - including those wearing paraphernalia or singing songs denigrating other members - to be subjected to the party\\'s disciplinary processes. But the party said that should this proposal be adopted, members would have to be educated and would not be hauled over the coals before any engagement. This radical proposal was adopted at the party\\'s provincial policy workshop and would be one of the proposals that the province would be taking to the national policy conference at Gallagher Estate in Joburg next week. Sihle Zikalala, the secretary of the ANC in KZN, said that this proposal was a reaffirmation of a decision by the party\\'s national executive committee that only its president was regarded as the face of the party. \"There is one face of the ANC, that is the president, and there is one president in the ANC,\" Zikalala said before adding that he was not campaigning for anyone. This resolution by KZN is seen as the province\\'s attempt to put a lid on campaigns against presidentJacob Zumawhose leadership of the party is expected to be challenged at the party\\'s national conference at Mangaung in December. In March this year a group of ANC Youth League members in Limpopo were seen wearing T-shirts bearing the face of ANC deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe - part of a campaign to unseat Zuma at the Mangaung conference. At the rally Motlanthe warned these members against wearing T-shirts with his face emblazoned on them. In another move which could come as a blow to Zuma\\'s critics - especially the youth league - KZN, which is backing Zuma\\'s re-election bid, also |rejected the wholesale nationalisation of mines, saying not only would \"classic nationalisation\" be unconstitutional but it would also be too costly to the state. The 500-strong KZN contingent of delegates agreed that if the state were to nationalise mines, it would have to compensate owners and that would cost the state a projected amount of more than R1 trillion, thus presenting the country\\'s economy with a \"massive calamity\". The province resolved that state intervention in the mining sector should be limited to taxation, royalties, ownership of strategic assets solely or in partnership with the private sector and equity ownership to certain companies. This is a departure from the position of some ANC structures - including the ANC Youth League - and Cosatu affiliates like Numsa which have been calling for the nationalisation of mines and expropriation of land without compensation. The ANC in KZN said that whereas the past two decades were about the attainment of political freedom, the next phase, particularly the first decade of the second century of the ANC, should be about the second transition - the attainment of all the ideas of the Freedom Charter, including economic transformation. Delegates called on the government to convene a national convention on economic transformation. The ANC\\'s disciplinary processes also featured strongly at the workshop - with delegates resolving that no member of the ANC\\'s national executive committee should represent any member being hauled before a disciplinary committee. They also resolved that no lawyers should represent members of the ANC appearing before any of its disciplinary committees. Zikalala said delegates had felt that involving lawyers in the process led to delays, while it could also mean that those members who could not afford such a service might be prejudiced. Asked if the proposals around the disciplinary processes had been informed by |recent cases involving former leaders of the youth league, |including Julius Malema, Zikalala conceded that was the |case, saying the organisation had been shaped by its experiences, including that one. The province also proposed that the number of provinces be reduced, saying that the |demarcation of the provinces still reflected the country\\'s |divided past with many of the provinces being demarcated along tribal lines. While the province would be sending the largest delegation of 509 members to the conference which would be attended by a total of 3 554 delegates, it would still need the backing of other provinces and party structures before these policies were adopted. Zikalala urged all 509 delegates to make themselves available for the national policy conference, saying there should be no apologies. He said KZN was determined to ensure that the party\\'s conferences this year were dignified. bheki.mbanjwa@inl.co.za\n",

      "GCIS Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa Cape Town - The fight for control of the National Treasury is expected to spill over into Parliament when Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will answer oral questions in the National Assembly. Ramaphosa, who last week came out in support of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, will face questions from parties in the chamber on Thursday. The deputy president’s defence of Gordhan came when the latter was expected to make a warning statement to the Hawks on Thursday, but he did not show up. This was after he had indicated he would not set foot in the Hawks\\' offices as he had not done anything wrong. The National Prosecuting Authority has since confirmed it received a docket from the Hawks. Gordhan had been under pressure from the beginning of the year after it was disclosed before his Budget in February that the Hawks were gunning for him. Cape Town - 160824 - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan went head to head with political commentator Justice Malala at the Cape Chamber of Commerce & Industrys second Rumble in the Urban Jungle event this year. The debate took place at The Westin Cape Town Hotel. Picture: David Ritchie David Ritchie The question-and-answer session in the National Assembly will give parties an opportunity to grill the deputy president. The opposition had been calling on President Jacob Zuma to intervene in the matter, but he has refused to do so. Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen, who briefly held the position of finance minister last year, had come out in support of Zuma and urged his successor at the Treasury to co-operate with the Hawks. The divisions in the country and within the ANC have been apparent, with the ANC Youth League also calling on Gordhan to co-operate with the crime unit. Ramaphosa was the first top official in the government and ANC to break ranks and back Gordhan. He warned that the situation was untenable and created divisions in the state. Ramaphosa is the country’s and ANC’s second in command. Zuma has stuck to his guns and refused to step in and resolve the impasse. Gordhan appeared to have lost another battle in Parliament after the SA Revenue Service tabled its strategic plan in the National Assembly. This followed a stand-off between Gordhan and his successor at Sars, Tom Moyane, over the new structure at Sars. Gordhan had refused to sign off on the agency\\'s new reorganisation plan for several months until Moyane had reversed his decision. This led to Parliament hauling the two parties over the coals and demanding the tabling of the Sars strategic plan by the end of July. This was done by Gordhan, and there was no indication from the Treasury if the finance minister had succumbed to the pressure and whether he had agreed to the new Sars structure.

      "A team of skill, flair, innovation, fun, and an incredible drinking talent, the Barbarians encapsulate all that is good in rugby and put it on display for the fans while suring up the sport\\'s fraternity behind the scenes. This year\\'s game is against the Springboks, and although the South Africans have already pooh-poohed entering into the spirit of the game, at least they have selected a squad of fringe players that will look to impress. On the other side of the fence, coach Robbie Deans has selected a team who are somewhat lacking in international experience, rather letting a few other fringe players get a taste of international rugby. In this group there are four South African\\'s who will face their country men in Stormers flyhalf Robert du Preez, Lions hooker Akker van der Merwe, and lock Martin Muller, as well as Hurricanes prop Reggie Goodes. Lions coach Johan Ackermann\\'s son, Ruan, is on the bench. Besides the South African\\'s there are some special names in this team that are worth keeping an eye on. Taqele Naiyaravoro The giant two-capped Wallaby wing was last on show for audiences of Super Rugby when he ran out for the Waratahs when they won the title in 2014. He was also part of the squad in 2015. A former Rugby League player Naiyaravoro is deceptively quick and an absolute wrecking ball, much in the mould of All Black Waisake Naholo. Look for the big man to be pulled off his wing a couple of times to really soften up the Boks\\' mid drift. Matt Faddes The Highlander\\'s underrated star in their Super Rugby season last year, Faddes was playing club rugby in Otago in 2015 before suddenly finding himself scoring 10 tries in the world\\'s toughest competition. Full of pace, with incredible vision and an eye for the line, Faddes will surprise many who give this unassuming winger even a sniff of a gap. Robert du Preez The Stormers flyhalf showed he could step up when the men from Cape Town suffered a bit of a flyhalf crisis at the beginning of the season, but for injury, he could well have seen himself in green and gold this tour. Able to play it tight, and kick his points, Du Preez also showed in the Varsity Cup that he has an eye for the line and the size to mix it up right at the coal face. His running of the game could be key for a dangerous Barbarian backline. Michael Fatialofa The athletic 24-year-old lock has been a revelation for the Hurricanes slotting into their free flowing style of play as if he was an outside back. Abrasive yet silky, tough as nails but a clever ball player, Fatialofa will no doubt thrive in a Barbarians team where he is allowed to throw the ball around and look for the miracle passes - which often stick from the big man. Akker van â€¨der Merwe The angry warthog, as he has been dubbed, Van der Merwe played a a small role for the Lions behind now Springbok Malcolm Marx, but when ever he did get a chance he set the stage on fire with his runs. Low to the ground and powerful through the tackle, he thrives in bounding his way through defences and will cause a number of problems in the tight loose for the Boks\n",

      "WHILE every avenue has been explored as to why the Boks are in such a poor state as to be just clipping a 40% win ratio this year, there has yet to be some real accountability from the man in charge. Allister Coetzee, in the wake of another history-making defeat by England, 37-21, is still clinging to blind optimism in the face of a national crisis; he has blamed the system, even the players and their execution, but never pointed a finger inwards. Coetzee\\'s lack of accountability began when he took a soft-handed swipe at the SA Rugby system, which led to a so-called \"Indaba\" aimed at aligning unions and the national system, while also focusing on up-skilling certain facets of play. Of course, a weekend conference was never going to magically turn the fortunes around of a beleaguered team, but what it did do is get the rabble-rousers focusing their discourse on a amateurish, and often corrupt, SA Rugby administration. However, SA Rugby\\'s issues, and their effect on the national team, are nothing new. The problem has been that the way rugby is run in South Africa has not changed for decades. Jake White was forced to deal with a stuffy SA Rugby boardroom that tried to interfere at every possible opportunity, hauling him back after a humiliating loss to Australia 49-0, in order to drag him over the coals. Yet, White was hugely ambitious, confident in himself, and bold enough to lead from the front and take all the praise, and criticism, on the chin. He accepted, evolved, fixed weak areas by bringing in new coaches, and eventually won the World Cup. Coetzee does not have the same backbone in times of a crisis, 2006 for White was probably a worse year than this one is currently as the Boks lost seven out of 12 games, but Coetzee has gone into his shell, shunned the media, and laid the blame elsewhere. Even his approach to blame his crop of players is a red herring to divert attention from his own shortcomings. While it is true that the Springboks lost a host of legendary players after the World Cup, New Zealand lost even more. And, before Coetzee can even try to blame SA Rugby\\'s non-committal to continuity and blooding of new players in the mould of the Kiwis, he need only look at his most recent opponent Eddie Jones. England made history by being the first host nation to not make the play-offs in the 2015 World up, which led to Stuart Lancaster losing his job. In stepped Eddie Jones, and with everyone holding their breath to see the drastic changes he would make in his first squad selection, Jones stuck with a huge majority of Lancaster\\'s team. The point being, regardless of if you lose a host of key players, or it appears your players aren\\'t good enough, a good coach can make them work for him. Unfortunately, Coetzee is not that kind of coach.\n",

      "THE Springboks reacted to their humiliation at the hands of the All Blacks by bringing back overseas-based flanker Francois Louw and gambling on utility back Dillyn Leyds for tomorrow\\'s Rugby Championship game against Australia in Bloemfontein. Coach Allister Coetzee, promising a strong response in Bloemfontein to the Springboks\\' record 57-0 loss to the All Blacks two weeks ago, was also able to recall regular scrumhalf Ross Cronje after illness. Coetzee hopes it will be enough to repair the Boks\\' shattered confidence after their heaviest defeat ever and stave off renewed calls for him to leave the job. Australia are poised to make the most of the Springbok\\'s woes, although the Wallabies haven\\'t won in South Africa since 2011 and have also switched things around . Lock Izack Rodda, flanker Jack Dempsey, and winger Marika Koroibete will start for Australia for the first time, part of coach Michael Cheika\\'s plan to \"change it up\" as he seeks his first win in South Africa. The 21-year-old Rodda, especially, will find himself at the coal face against the desperate Springboks. \"Izack is young, he is eager, and I want to give them these experiences so they can learn,\" Cheika said. \"I don\\'t think there is any risk there because he has come off the bench and played well in two big games and I can\\'t see why starting is any different. It\\'s a step along the way.\" History is against Australia, who have struggled in South Africa for the last six years. The Wallabies may be boosted by the fact that they ran New Zealand close last month, something South Africa hasn\\'t been able to do for years. For South Africa, Louw comes in at flank for Jean-Luc du Preez and Leyds at right wing for Raymond Rhule, who was severely criticised for his defensive performance against the rampant All Blacks in Albany. Chiliboy Ralepelle, has been brought in on the bench and could play his first Test since 2013. Rhule and scrumhalf Francois Hougaard, who started two weeks ago, have paid the biggest prices for the 57-0 drubbing by being left out of the 23 completely. Rhule was sent back to his domestic team as Coetzee was forced to act after the worst of a string of embarrassing results in his 18-month reign. \"We know we had a substandard game, but we have put it behind us and are busy with our turnaround strategy,\" he said. \"The players and management have had a meeting, and we all want to make things right this week.\" The team had now \"buried Albany,\" Coetzee said. \"That defeat won\\'t define us. We\\'re not going to sweep it under the carpet, but so far we have won five out of seven this season, and at times we\\'ve played outstanding rugby. What is key now is our response.\"\n",

      "In the wake of the 38-3 drubbing suffered by the Boks at the hands of the much smarter Irish, there are no positives to be taken. That is not only the sentiments of the public that watched the game, but the coach himself. Allister Coetzee, usually PC and prepared enough for the harshest of dragging over the coals, was surprisingly candid in his appraisal of his team\\'s poor performance in Dublin. \"It is difficult to explain... there are frankly no positives to be taken from that performance,\" a browbeaten Coetzee said after the encounter. \"We let ourselves down, we let our supporters back home down and we have three games left on tour to fight back.\" After the Test in Albany, against the All Blacks which ended 57-0, the coach said he saw positives. Many again scratched their head at what he saw, however, there was some vindication soon after in Cape Town. A one-point loss adding hope. However, this latest record defeat against Ireland has left many stumped as to how the Springboks can turn things around. A kick in the pants may be enough to wake the Boks up, and if their pattern is to be adhered to then France could be in for a backlash, but there needs to be more than reactionary fightbacks. The winning culture of the Springboks is clearly absent. Under the current coach they have won nine of 22 matches with only two of those being on the road. \"Look, the 57-0 Albany defeat to the All Blacks was tough but we came back and I\\'m sure we will do so again,\" Coetzee added, again referring to the reactionary way the Boks are bouncing from one game to another. The Boks are left with France, Italy, and Wales, and while Ireland was definitely pegged as their toughest encounter of the four match tour, the remaining nations must be licking their lips. The whitewashing of France earlier in the year will feel much like a forgotten memory for the South Africans, while for the home side, revitalised and at the start of their season, they will be sniffing out revenge. Italy, too, so often a game for the dirt-trackers, will have a hopeful feeling of pleasant deja vu on their minds when they welcome the Boks, having picked up the win last time out. Wales also have a chance of really running salt into a wound that the Boks may not be able to recover from as Coetzee\\'s continuity plan will have to take a back seat with a number of overseas players heading back to their clubs for that clash. Changes need to be made, and unfortunately, the scapegoats of Raymond Rhule and Damien de Allende are simply not enough any more. South Africans are always very quick to call for the chop of the national coach, but sometimes it is quite warranted.\n",

      "A N employee of a local company will be hauled over the coals for posting a demeaning photograph of a heavily pregnant black woman having an ultrasound of the baby - and the screen shows a gorilla as the baby. The photo, posted by Deresh Ashokumar on PG Glass\\'s WhatsApp group last Monday, angered other employees. The employees, who asked to remain anonymous, said they did not believe their immediate management had taken the matter seriously enough. \"We take offence to this irresponsible act which sought to insult black people. It was surprising that the management would ask us what we wanted to see happen to the wrongdoer. It\\'s shocking that people continue with the reckless usage of social media to expose their racist attitudes. \"Even when this man was warned about what he had done, he did not show any remorse. It was only when the headquarters in Johannesburg intervened that the matter received attention from the regional managers,\" said one. Apparently the employees are divided on how the matter should be handled, with some saying the employee should be fired while others believed he should be made to apologise and given a warning. \"It\\'s the minority that speaks of an apology and warning, but the majority says he must go because when this was first brought to his attention he didn\\'t show that he cared about how we feel. It\\'s obvious that whenever he is around us he sees gorillas, monkeys and baboons. This cannot be forgiven and if a black man had committed an offence it would have been a different story. \"If the management does not condone racism, then that should show in how they deal with this racist individual,\" said another employee. PG Glass has since confirmed that the company has begun disciplinary proceedings regarding the matter. Logan Govindaraj, the company\\'s KZN Metro regional manager, said they took the matter \"very seriously\" and would arrange a hearing. \"The complainants will be given an opportunity to discuss their views on the matter and will await the outcome once the hearing is concluded. The employee in question will be notified of the date for the hearing. \"We talked to all the employees across the racial groups and we are now waiting for the employees who raised a concern about the photo to provide written statements. \"When we spoke to the one who posted the picture he said he posted it as a joke. \"Once the process is concluded, it is the chairman who will have a final say on the matter depending on what transpired during the hearing,\" Govindaraj said. When interviewed by the Daily News yesterday, Ashokumar said he posted the photo by mistake. Asked how he got it on his phone, he said it was sent to him by an unknown person via WhatsApp. \"It was an honest mistake. Someone sent it to me a couple of days before it landed on the company WhatsApp group. My application was active and I accidentally pressed the send button to the company WhatsApp group. I\\'m not a racist and, for me, skin colour doesn\\'t matter. \"I\\'ve never had issues with my colleagues before,\" Ashokumar said. The South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) criticised the picture, saying it was \"truly offensive\". \"It capitalises on a common racial trope of black people being like monkeys, or gorillas in this case. There is nothing that can explain this picture: it is offensive and in very poor taste. The person who posted it cannot say he would have done the same if the picture had been of a white woman. This trope has never been used in the context of a white person,\" SAIRR policy fellow Sara Gon said. She said the additional problem with the post was that it was put on a company Whatsapp group. \"It is inexplicable whether the group is an informal group of PG Glass employees or an official PG Glass company Whatsapp group. However, if it is the latter there are the added elements of being condoned by the company or bringing the company into disrepute. \"It is likely to harm the company anyway, as these things seldom stay within the intended group.\" She said the company should have a grievance procedure. \"I recommend that the employees who are offended lodge a grievance in terms of the grievance procedure on an urgent basis to the most senior level of management. \"They should request that management discipline the employee for racism, insulting fellow employees and for abuse of the company\\'s Whatsapp group which (presumably) is used by employees of all colours. \"Unless there are grounds for any other penalty, dismissal is likely to be appropriate. If management doesn\\'t respond timeously, undertaking to process the matter with the urgency it deserves, the group should then refer it to the managing director of the holding company. Thereafter, should it go that far there is a referral to the CCMA for an unfair labour practice and or referral to the Equality Court,\" Gon said.\n",

      "Paraphrasing Noam Chomsky, \"The ANC KwaZulu-Natal is stumbling the province around in a fog of mystification.\" Indeed, KZN is \"headed to hell in a handbasket\", as TS Elliot might say. The citizens of KZN by and large are clinging to a threadbare cloth. A frightful fall is imminent, the consequences of which we will endure for generations. Regrettably, our so-called African leaders collectively feign blindness and deafness. They have forsaken their leadership obligations. And in so doing, they have increased the burden that pins down the natural progression of our community. O Jeffrey, in his book After The Darkest Night Comes the Day: Change, quotes a heart-piercing speech by Martin Luther King jr on March31, 1968, when addressing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference at the Episcopal National Cathedral, Washington, DC. He said: \"On some positions, Cowardice asks the question, \\'Is it safe?\\' Expediency asks the question, \\'Is it politic?\\' And Vanity comes along and asks the question, \\'Is it popular?\\' \"But Conscience asks the question, \\'Is it right?\\' And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor political, nor popular, but he must do it because Conscience tells him it is right.\" In the past, we rallied around political goals conceptualised from an ethos of Ubuntu, the African conception of humanism that proclaimed \"an injury to one is an injury to all\". Does it still apply today? We Africans must ask ourselves some hard questions, in particular about what is right and what has gone terribly wrong in our province. \"We are sick and tired of working without being paid. Transnet is getting millions from eThekwini municipality... but every month we are not getting paid on time,\" said Nhlanhla Bhengu. On February1, 2016, Bhengu and his fellow drivers were referred to as \"nonsensical\" when they blocked the flow of traffic in the Durban city centre. There was no public outcry regarding their grievances. These breadwinners were stripped of their dignity and manhood, and disempowered as the protectors and providers of their families. Contemplate in totality the repercussions of a man who says: \"I am in debt now because I have to borrow money to buy groceries.\" While these breadwinners, embarking on strikes, were confronted with failing to provide basic needs to their dependants, community leaders and politicians stuck their heads in the sand. Church leaders, meanwhile, failed to stand up and defend the exploited. The recent crop of social justice and empowerment organisations, and black professional organisations that claim to speak for the exploited, were conspicuously silent. Meanwhile, the injustice was not meted out by Indian, white, or coloured business people, but by a company owned by an African family. There was no \"injury to one is any injury to all\". Where is our Ubuntu now? eThekwini councillors are being pompous and arrogant. They pretend to know little about poverty. It is sad that almost all of them have forgotten that they come from the most humble family backgrounds. Remember the aborted sinful boat cruise where 40 councillors were expected to board the MSC Sinfonia for a cruise to the Portuguese Islands between March4 and 7 in 2016? The cruise was to be at the expense of ratepayers. It is one of many excruciating kicks in the teeth of the destitute. The same councillors have been accused, by their own bodyguards, of ignoring their challenges: \"We have been raising our salary predicament since 2005. We have raised it with management; the city manager is aware of it.\" Are the souls of our African academics, intellectuals and community leaders in covenant with cowardliness, expediency, and vanity? The hope and soul of the community is wretchedly laid bare for the prophets of mirage to feast on. Our historical quest to attain social justice for all has been forsaken on the floor to be stamped by scoundrels who masquerade as the voice of the downtrodden. Who has the courage and the will to pick up the ethos of social justice among the current crop of African community leaders? Who monitors the most excruciating injustices meted out against citizens in KwaZulu-Natal? The Xubera Institute for Research and Development (Xubera) believes that among the citizens of KwaZulu-Natal we have plenty of people who possess a spirit of bravery, honesty and integrity. Africans cannot forever survive on the benevolence of other community leaders. The silence of our community leaders was exposed by Professor McQuoid-Mason, president of the Commonwealth Legal Education Association, who took it upon himself to approach the public protector about the living conditions and ongoing killings in Glebelands Hostel, Umlazi, south of Durban. He did not seek political leadership directives or a government meeting for approval to tackle the dilemma. Dr Rama Naidu of the Democracy Development Programme and Vasu Gounden of the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes have been at the coal face of untangling these social knots for decades. Their research institutes are non-partisan and financially self-sustaining. They operate outside the confines of traditional academic institutions. Professors Salim Abdool Karim and Quarraisha Abdool Karim have deservedly been honoured internationally for their sterling work in health science research. Their Centre for the Aids Programme of Research in South Africa has become an internationally recognised institution. Dr Imtiaz Sooliman of Gift of the Givers is undisputed so far. Advocate Kessie Naidoo, Professor Hoosen (Jerry) Coovadia, Ela Gandhi, Judge Zakaria Mohammed Yacoob and Professor Ashwin Desai are independent, determined, and honest knights in shining armour on behalf of their communities. All these community leaders have scars that bear testimony to their commitment to a good cause. They do not mind going public and standing against a popular tide to speak the truth. Surely every Indian child wishes to emulate the character of these individuals? Material poverty imbued with hopelessness is spiritually disempowering, leading to a multiplicity of vulnerability. Toxic tentacles of political parties have encroached and enfolded the spiritual space. Political leaders have ascended to an incarnation of hope. The church principals have relegated themselves to being midgets compared with political leaders. They are on their feeble knees with bowed spines, begging for mercy from political leaders. In the recent xenophobia outbreak, the public took note of an assortment of church leaders, in their medieval regalia, being shepherded to the valley of nothingness by municipal officials and politicians. In the twinkling of an eye, without reporting a substantial solution emanating from their soliloquies with municipality officials, they disappeared to their respective bottomless holes. Traditionally, church leaders are perceived as crusaders of truth and protectors of the vulnerable. Strangely, we have not heard them protesting against social ills, rampant government and corporate corruption, and the prevailing apartheid system that excludes and still thrives on dehumanising African people. In this valley of silence, especially from church leaders, one recalls Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor and an anti-Nazi dissident who once said, \"Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.\" Karl Marx departed somewhat early, not having had the chance to witness the mutation of political parties to become the \"opium of the people\". In African countries, after the de-legislation of colonial laws, the anointed liberation political party evolved into a super-social structure. It re-engineered the values, beliefs and norms of the country. Christopher Hadnagy eloquently summarises it as \\'\"social engineering is an art. It further disempowers the oppressed. Subsequently the national symbol of citizenship and identity is replaced by that of the anointed political liberation party. Scholars of sociology will argue that it is precarious when impermanent social structures such as political parties redefine the identity, morals and ethics of any community. The National Party and National Socialist German Workers\\' Party are infamous examples. The point of analysis converges to the reality that a lack of fearless truth-tellers within the African community is due to a fear of ostracism. Let the conscience of African academics, church leaders, professionals, the business community, forward thinkers and many more, lead them to do the right thing by warmly embracing the frail hands of the condemned. It is time for community leaders to take a position that is \"neither safe, nor political, nor popular, but they must do what conscience tells them is right\". I still hold the belief that the African soul and integrity have not been devoured by the offers of impotent government appointments such as commissions, boards and other non-consequential committees. Let every African citizen be brave and lead our beloved province to \"throw off the yoke of slavery\". For the sake of the next generation, we must depart from this earth knowing that we stopped Africans from salivating randomly for hand-outs and crumbs from the leaders of other communities. l Dube is a senior researcher at the Xubera Institute for Research and Development\n",

Luzipo said the rate at which workers were dying at Sibanye mines had reached \"disastrous proportions\" This comes after Sibanye confirmed on Tuesday that a mineworker had died at its Khomanani mine at the Driefontein operation, west of Johannesburg, after he entered a scraper path and was caught by the scraper. This latest incident brings to six the number of Sibanye workers who have died in one month, raising the number of fatalities to 21 in 10 incidents since the beginning of the year. Earlier this month, five mineworkers died at Sibanye\\'s Kloof Ikamva shaft in Driefontein after they entered an abandoned shaft with poor ventilation and died from gas and heat exposure. Luzipo said that it was high time Sibanye was placed under curatorship. \"In the interim, it will be best for the company to have someone competent to oversee its daily operations, to take decisions that will be in the best interest of the wellbeing of workers,\" he said. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) called for Sibanye to brief committee on safety incidents, saying that it would write to Luzipo to schedule an emergency meeting for the company to brief it. Sibanye will on Friday convene a safety summit in a bid to collectively address these incidents and re-establish its safety record. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Chantall Presence\n",

      "Premiers have expressed their wishes on what the National Council of provinces (NCOP) should do for their provinces. Parliament - Premiers have expressed their wishes on what the National Council of provinces (NCOP) should do for their provinces in the sixth term of the second House of Parliament. This emerged when the NCOP held its first sitting for the term on Thursday. Gauteng Premier David Makhura said they put their hopes as provinces on the NCOP. Makhura said one of the first things they would ask NCOP to look at was the size of their legislature. \"We have put this matter before the fifth NCOP and that matter was not concluded,\" he said. Makhura said Gauteng has the largest population and its maximum of MPLs was supposed to be 80. \"On behalf of the people of our province, we want to say it should be among the first priorities of the sixth NCOP,\" he said. North West Premier Job Mokgoro said his rural province has witnessed public protests with communities raising complaints. Mokgoro said the protests have shifted from urban to rural areas over cross-cutting issues contained in memorandum of complaints they attended to over provision of adequate clean water and improved road infrastructure, among others. The province was still under administration and several more municipalities were also placed under administration. \"We are making steady progress to stabilise public services in North West,\"Mokgoro said. \"I want to appeal that there is there is a dire need to place much more emphasis on intervention in our ailing municipalities. This should be done not only in North West but jerk up service delivery in all struggling municipalities across the country as these are the coal face of service delivery,\" he said. Northern Cape Premier Zamani Saul said the issue of review of formula of the equitable share, allocations made by National Treasury to provinces based on population, should be revisited. \"It disadvantages us. It does not take into account numbers and vastness you have. It is expensive to implement decisions by virtue of distances we need to travel,\" Saul said. \"We commit to put this item on the agenda of this legislative sector,\" he said. However, other premiers focused on realising the needs of the people and need to put the interests of their provinces first. Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela said they had moved around all provinces during elections and heard what people wanted. \"We have listened to them as they were telling us about their needs. We heard our people cry for better and faster service delivery. They have cried for jobs for their children. They want houses, water and electricity,\" Ntombela said. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala said they continue to work together as provinces to raise issues that affected their respective provinces. \"We want to remind this House that it derives its existence from the will of the people as they expressed themselves on May 8 in the elections. \"We should accept and work together and represent South Africans genuinely and pursue their interests,\" Zikalala said. Limpopo\\'s delegate Mamagase Nchabeleng said their task was to ensure aspirations and interests of provinces were carried out and ensure issues emanating from provinces were represented by those sent to the NCOP. Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtsweni urged NCOP delegates to be driven by a relentless commitment to improve the quality of life of South Africans. Mtsweni said Mpumalanga delegates should execute their responsibilities without fear. \"If you are partisan, be partisan for the interests of Mpumalanga and South Africa,\" she said.

Durban - Although he does not agree with those who say the ANC should haul Zindzi Mandela over the coals for her divisive views aired on Twitter over the weekend on the land issue and white South Africans in general, ANC KZN chairperson Sihle Zikalala says the issue of land must be raised without compromising reconciliation efforts and the economy. Zikalala was exclusively speaking to Independent Media on Monday on the sidelines of the ongoing KZN cabinet lekgotla taking place in Durban. \"The transformation of land and ensuring that land is redistribute(d) to the people is important. But in doing that we should not undermine the progress we have made in the area of reconciliation, but also in the area of ensuring economic growth. As we transfer land to the people, we should do that in a manner that is responsible in building the country and the economy,\" said Zikalala in reaction to Mandela\\'s series of tweets. He shot down calls for Mandela, 59, who is the country\\'s ambassador to Denmark, to be punished as her behaviour was not befitting the role of an ambassador who should always be diplomatic in raising issues. Radical Afrikaner affirmation group, AfriForum even want her to be fired as a diplomat while the Nelson Mandela Foundation which, among other things, is meant to preserve the legacy of her father, Dr Nelson Mandela, wants an audience with her. The Black First Land First (BLF) has called for a \"collective defense\" of her.

They have got their individual (capacity), they have got a right to express themselve(s),\" Zikalala said in response to the calls. Zikalala added that the land issue must be tackled by those in power as per the resolution of the ANC. \"But once issues are raised, those of us who are in positions of processing those issues, we should take those issues and process those issues in a responsible manner,\" he said.

      "Allegations that Stevens Mokgalapa was having sex with a colleague have brought back memories other sex scandals involving politicians and government officials. Allegations that Tshwane mayor Stevens Mokgalapa was recently caught with his pants down and having sex with a colleague,MMC for Transport Sheila Senkubuge, have brought back memories other sex scandals involving politicians and government officials. Some of those implicated were eventually ousted from their positions while others were merely shifted to other higher positions. We look at a few of the scandals, from Zwelinzima Vavi\\'s alleged trysts with married co-workers to John Steenhuisen\\'s alleged adultery with a DA colleague at the party\\'s Durban offices. Stevens Mokgalapa On Sunday Mokgalapa and Senkubuge hogged headlines when an apparent audio recording of them engaging in what first started as toxic office gossip and later a sexual encounter, was leaked. Information shows that the recording was recorded late last month but it is not clear who recorded it and why. It is puzzling though how senior public figures like the two would allow themselves to be overcome by their sexual desires and engage in sex right inside an office when there is a always a high probability that it may be under surveillance. IOL reported on Monday that Mokgalapa has since laid charges of extortion and invasion of privacy against some known and unknown individuals at the Brooklyn police station as well as with the Hawks. Zwelinzima Vavi In 2013, Vavi, the then all powerful general secretary of the Confederation of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) was embroiled in a sex scandal where he allegedly had a \"brief\" sexual encounter with a married women who worked at the federation\\'s headquarters in Johannesburg. The scandal caused a headache for Vavi who viewed it as an attempt to politically eliminate him as he was leading a campaign against the Jacob Zuma presidency and called for Cosatu to pull out of the alliance. The scandal came to the open when the woman and her husband demanded R2 million from Vavi in order to keep quiet. Cosatu hauled Vavi over the coals for the matter.John Steenhuisen In 2010, the DA\\'s interim national leader John Steinhuisen was at the centre of a adultery scandal. Then the leader of the KZN provincial caucus, Steenhuisen allegedly wrecked the marriage of a colleague when he dated his colleague\\'s wife. When the Sunday Tribune quizzed him about the matter at the time, Steenhuisen said: \"my private life is a private matter\". The affair ultimately saw Steenhuisen\\'s wife file for divorce - nullifying a ten-year marriage. … A quick look at some office sex scandals by lesser-known government officials In the KZN provincial government circles and some of its entities, office sex scandals have been reported before. Around 2013 an official based in the Pietermaritzburg office of the department of land affairs, became the talk of the town when he was allegedly caught having sex with a junior female staff member in his office. It is not clear what happened to the female staff member but the official is still at work and is handling land claims across the province. Still in KZN, one of the biggest entities owned by the KZN provincial government, Ezemvelo, was around 2014 rocked by a sex scandal involving a female clerk and a senior official. The official was allegedly caught red handed having sex with the clerk and he later resigned before he could be disciplined for the scandal.

      "Former eThekwini mayor and KZN MPL Zandile Gumede is once again in hot water as the ANC intends to haul her over the coals for not reining in her supporters who allegedly berated party leaders and tarnished the party\\'s brand. In the latest battle between the two, the party wants Gumede to explain the conduct of her \"supporters\" who hoisted \"offensive\" placards outside the Durban Magistrate\\'s Court last Thursday shortly after she, long-time loyalist Mondli Mthembu, and 15 others appeared before the Durban Commercial Crimes Court. They face charges of corruption emanating from a R430 million tender issued in 2017 while Gumede was mayor. One placard indirectly attacked provincial chairperson and Premier Sihle Zikalala and senior councillor and KZN ANC youth league provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo. One placard implied Zikalala was watching while Gumede was being abused through politically motivated charges in court. Another implied that Sabelo was a political troublemaker that had destroyed the youth league. Addressing the media in Durban yesterday on the outcomes of the provincial executivecommittee (PEC) meeting, provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said the party intended to haul Gumede over the coals for the incident. \"We condemn that in the strongest terms and it\\'s a matter that we are going to discuss with comrade Zandile... When she addressed those people she did not say \\'I appreciate your support during the difficulties I am confronted with but I condemn your conduct that sow divisions in the ANC\\',\" Ntuli said. Gumede declined to comment when asked how she felt about being held accountable for her supporters\\' conduct. \"I don\\'t have any comment for now,\" Gumede said in response. The PEC meeting was expected to come out with a full list of party members in a leadership position facing allegations and obliged to step aside. However, while the matter was discussed in detail, the party could not produce a final list.\n",

      "Johannesburg - Under fire spokesperson of the MKMVA and senior employee in the office of the secretary-general of the ANC, Carl Niehaus was not forthcoming on whether he had shown cause why he should not be suspended. Niehaus was on Thursday expected to write to ANC general manager Febe Potgieter-Gqubule and show cause why he should not be suspended from his duties. This was after on January 14 he issued a press statement that lampooned the ruling party\\'s deputy secretary-general, Jessie Duarte. Duarte had invited the wrath of Niehaus after she told JJ Tabane of eNCA that she wouldn\\'t respond to statements made by the MKMVA (uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association) spokesperson because he was \"not an elected leader of the ANC\". He felt Duarte was eroding his contribution to the struggle. \"I am saddened that even the deputy secretary-general of the ANC, comrade Jessie Duarte, saw it fit to attack me and undermine my long history as a 42-year veteran of the ANC in good standing, as well as my elected position as an NEC member of MKMVA, and MKMVA national spokesperson. \\'\\'This she did, knowing that when she was doing so, I was gravely ill. It was unnecessary and callous – I am deeply saddened by it,\" Niehaus wrote in the statement. By doing so, the ANC said he has crossed the line, hence the intention to haul him over the coals. Potgieter-Gqubule told him that his statement was in bad taste for an ANC employee working in a critical office. \"You have been advised, on more than one occasion, that your public statements and social media posts are unbecoming of someone working in this high office, which has the primary responsibility of driving and co-ordinating the work of all structures of the ANC. You also received a written warning to this effect on 12 October, 2019. \"The latest statement, titled \\'Personal Statement by Carl Niehaus about his ongoing Recovery from Covid-19 Pneumonia\\', dated Thursday 14 January, 2021 ... crosses all boundaries expected from an ANC employee, and particularly someone of your seniority. In particular, the personal attack on the ANC deputy secretary-general in this statement is a serious violation of the ANC Personnel Policy Manual. \\'\\'ANC staff members are expected to abide by the discipline of the organisation, and personal attacks by a member of staff on elected leadership – without even attempting to address the matter internally – is unprofessional, is not tolerated and is in violation of the manual,\" reads part of the letter of intent to suspend Niehaus. On Thursday Niehaus was unfazed, saying he was more concerned with getting better as advised by his doctors and could not say whether or not he had met the deadline. \"I am not making any further comment to the media. I have been told by my doctor to only concentrate on my health and trying to recuperate. I hope you will understand, and give me the space to do so,\" he said. ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe could not confirm whether Niehaus had met the deadline or not. When called, he asked to be given time to prioritise the sudden passing of NEC member and Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu.

      "Johannesburg - Former State Security Agency (SSA) boss Arthur Fraser is pursuing perjury charges against former minister Sydney Mufamadi and the acting director-general of the spy agency, Loyiso Jafta. He argues the two lied before the Zondo Commission by claiming that assets of the agency worth R9 billion are not accounted for. He says the correct figure is R9 million and Jafta should have corrected \"the lie\" which was started by Mufamadi but he instead chose to confirm it. He also wants Ms K, who testified last week, and Mr Y to be hauled over the coals for lying about the vetting of staff at the SSA. In a 36-page affidavit meant for the SAPS and seen by Independent Media, Fraser says it was embarrassing for Jafta to perpetuate a lie as a senior accounting officer of the spy agency. \"On 25 January 2021, Dr Mufamadi appeared before the commission where the oath was administered to him by the commission\\'s registrar and after which he tendered\\xa0his viva voce evidence. Pretorius SC led Dr Mufamadi\\'s evidence assisted by Adv\\xa0September. \\'\\'Of relevance to my complaint, Dr Mufamadi, inter alia, testified the\\xa0following: During the audit, management was unable to provide documentation to verify\\xa0operational expenditure of R125.6m or that the money was used (for) the intended\\xa0purpose. \\'\\'The AG was unable to confirm redundant assets in excess of R9bn as there was\\xa0insufficient audit evidence and the assets could \\'not be located by the agency\\',\" he said. He stressed that the AG\\'s report for the period 2017/2018 recorded redundant assets amounting to R9.042m, not in excess of R9bn and the spy agency, under his watch, also submitted to Parliament\\'s joint standing committee on intelligence that insufficient audit evidence could be obtained in respect of redundant assets. \"Inflating the redundant asset value from R9.042m to in excess of R9bn amounts to grossly mendacious conduct. There was a legal duty on Dr Mufamadi, the SSA witnesses and the commission\\'s evidence leaders to verify the correctness hereof prior to presenting such falsity under oath. \\'\\'It is also untrue that documentary evidence relating to the R125.6m used for operational expenditure could not be provided by the SSA. \\'\\'I have been advised by Ms Roxane Human (\\'Ms Human\\') that the documentation is available within the SSA and was handed over to the then special adviser to the acting director-general, Mr Jafta, along with other documentation on or about 3 May 2018,\" Fraser said in the affidavit. Furthermore, he wants Mufamadi to be penalised for telling the commission that a warehouse which has employed his son was a front company for the SSA. He said he admitted that his son was employed by the said company but did not say it was a front company for the spy agency. Regarding Ms K and Mr Y, he claimed that they both lied by saying that he employed unvetted staff as SSA members when, at the time they were employed, he was not part of the agency. It is not clear which police station is processing the case. It was also not clear by the time of publication whether Mufamadi and Jafta had been notified that there are pending investigations against them.

      "Video by Sihle Mavuso Durban - Despite prior efforts to ensure the matter did not bite it, the long-standing issue of Zulu kingship and the role played by the King during the opening of the KwaZulu-Natal legislature came back to haunt it on Thursday, nearly derailing the annual event. On Tuesday this week, the Speaker of the legislature, Ntombeko Boyce announced that the de facto King, Misuzulu KaZwelithini, had been invited but he won\\'t be able to address it until after his coronation. That was the arrangement when they met the King with a delegation of all political parties from the legislature. However, in a sudden twist on Thursday, when the province\\'s Premier, Sihle Zikalala took to the podium to give the State of the Province Address, EFF member of the provincial legislature (MPL), Vusi Khoza stood up to demand answers regarding the presence of the King, prompting ANC chief whip Super Zuma to say Khoza was misleading the house and he should be investigated. Minutes into Zikalala\\'s speech, sirens were heard outside, and it was when the King\\'s convoy, escorted by singing and high-spirited Zulu regiments, arrived at the venue. Their singing could be heard even by Boyce and Zikalala, who halted his speech for the King to make a royal entrance with a large entourage and his praiser singers competing for prominence.  Video: Sihle Mavuso/ IOL Politics Zikalala himself, just before resuming his long speech, gave the King the customary royal salute for all reigning Kings, saying: \"Wena Wendlovu. Wena Wendlovu, Bayede!\" The King took a seat in front of Zikalala and the proceedings of the day went on, with the King listening with his first wife, Queen Ntokozo Mayisela-Zulu. After the address, opposition parties slated Zikalala and the ANC-controlled legislature for its handling of the matter. The president of the IFP, Velenkosini Hlabisa, was particularly scathing, saying the matter was badly handled, and it brought back bad memories of how the apartheid government nearly wiped out the monarchy through such behaviour. \"It was a disappointment to invite his majesty, take a salute to him as Bayede (King), but behave as if he is not part of the gathering. The silencing of his majesty is unfortunate by our new democratic system. We know where we come from where the traditional institution had been undermined by the apartheid system,\" Hlabisa said. Khoza of the EFF said the ANC-controlled legislature was being mischievous by saying technically there is no King, as they were heard shouting the \"Bayede salute\" meaning they recognise him. \"Bayede to who? These are hypocrites, we know that we have got a King, it\\'s just a question of a technicality where colonialism said somebody must sign some paper,\" Khoza said. The leader of the DA in KZN, Francois Rodgers, said they all agreed the King who is regarded as \"Prince\" was confusing. \"To see him (King Misuzulu) arrive today and see him greeted as an official royalty, one has to wonder whether in fact there is party politics at play here from the ANC, because they say one thing in the legislature, and when we come to the events of this nature there is an absolute 360,\" Rodgers said. But Zikalala defended the move, saying \"I take no issues from that\" as there \"are many people who arrive late.\" \"We believe that what you see as a controversy, for us, is not a controversy,\" Zikalala said. Regarding Zikalala\\'s speech, opposition parties were unanimous that it did not cover all the aspects of what it needed to cover regarding the state of the province. Hlabisa said it was disappointing that only R100 million was being allocated for youth empowerment, saying funds were allocated for incorrect priorities when the challenge of youth unemployment is known. Khoza concurred that the issue of youth unemployment was a challenge, and that Zikalala did not sufficiently address it. Rodgers said Zikalala did not address the issue of corruption and how it was being tackled head-on as a scourge, and who was being hauled over the coals for the July unrest. \"Furthermore, tell us who is being arrested and who is being charged?\" Rodgers asked. sihle.mavuso@inl.co.za Political Bureau Daily News  1999 - 2022 Independent Newspapers (Pty) Limited.

As it stands local government carries the burden of being at the coal face of the developmental state. \"However, the added cost burden of blackouts will slow the delivery of basic services and interventions to reduce poverty and inequality.\" The actual figure of the spending was not immediately available on Tuesday.

However, despite this, Eskom has not proved as loyal and considerate a service provider. \"The public utility has failed at its core mandate leaving residents and businesses quite literally in the dark. What is more frustrating is that Eskom has for many years enjoyed a legislated monopoly over power production: and in many ways still enjoys such a monopoly. \"The rotational blackouts are having a devastating effect on our local economy during a time when it can scarcely afford to shed any more jobs and poverty is the deepest that it has ever been,\" he said.

      "The South African government has been hauled over the coals by a Pretoria High Court judge for not protecting its citizens from Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe\\'s land expropriations. The government was ordered to pay damages to a South African farmer to whom it failed to provide diplomatic protection after Mugabe\\'s government seized 11 of his farms in Zimbabwe without compensation. The damages could amount to R100 million. Free State farmer Crawford von Abo, who began farming in Zimbabwe 50 years ago, was arrested for \"trespassing\" on his main farm in 1997 and spent time in a Zimbabwean jail. He turned to then president Thabo Mbeki for diplomatic protection and, later, the courts. In July 2008 the Pretoria High Court ruled that Von Abo was entitled to protection from the South African government. But he did not receive this. Last week, Judge Bill Prinsloo ruled that Von Abo must be paid damages by the SA government.\n",

Crosshead Copy Second par Crosshead Copy conomic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Zungu penned a gushing tribute to the way the ANC president \"disarmed\" an international correspondent, made \"poignant\" remarks in seminar rooms and lunches, and was likened to Brazilian P Figures on liquidations and insolvencies were once a useful indicator of economic conditions. When times got bad and people defaulted on their debt, disgruntled creditors sought a legal remedy to get their money back, liquidating companies and declaring people insolvent. But things have changed. Azar Jammine, the chief economist at Econometrix, says the figures on liquidations and insolvencies have not shown the surge in financial distress that \"might have been expected\" over the last year. The economy contracted for three consecutive quarters, starting at the end of 2008, and banks reported a sharp rise in bad debt. But there was not a similar increase in liquidations and insolvencies, according to Jammine. He attributes this partly to the National Credit Act (NCA), introduced in 2007, which \"may have caused creditors to use other methods to get their money back, possibly reaching agreements with people who are defaulting on their debt. Creditors can\\'t easily put pressure on (defaulters) to pay up.\" The NCA shifted the balance of power between lenders and borrowers. Among other things it introduced the concept of \"reckless lending\" - lending money to people who are in no position to pay it back. And it gave borrowers the right to get their debt repayments rearranged, if they were unable to meet their original commitments. Jammine says another complication is the \"huge bureaucracy\" involved in putting people into liquidation. The process is so time consuming that it is proving a big disincentive to creditors trying to get their money back. This is probably a major reason why bank credit is taking so long to recover. On a year-on-year basis, credit granted to the private sector has been falling since late last year. While it may delay the recovery, the shift in behaviour will save both lenders and borrowers a lot of pain down the line. Finance Followers of economic trends and financial markets had expected that the next big news, after the global economic crisis of the past two years, would be long-term economic recovery. After all, comments from observers were bullish about the economic recovery and the stability of financial markets going forward. But this country\\'s corporate world - at the coal face of anything that could go wrong in our economy - believes that risks are still there and anything can happen. Dave Brink, the chairman of Absa, South Africa\\'s biggest retail bank, says the fiscal stresses of euro zone countries such as Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal have added to the global economic uncertainty. How these stresses are resolved might affect interest rates and investor confidence. Brink says the level of global co-ordination by regulators, governments and the private sector has been impressive. But there are signs that this co-ordination is beginning to fragment. Some countries, most notably the US, have embarked on reforms that are out of step with the proposals agreed last year by the Group of 20 (G20) nations, the Financial Stability Forum and the Bank of International Settlements. Last year, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors agreed on the need for more stringent capital requirements for risky trading activities and off-balance sheet items. They also agreed on greater disclosure of the level and structure of remuneration for those whose actions have a material impact on risk taking. Brink\\'s comments come shortly after Philip Broadley, the group finance director at Old Mutual, said the continued volatility in world economic conditions could hit the global wealth manager\\'s performance. He said volatility in world economic conditions had created uncertainty in equity markets and currency fluctuations. This basically means South Africa should brace itself for another round of job losses. This could really be bad for the economy, which has already shed 1 million jobs. page 19 Broadcasting The staggered unveiling of TopTV, the new, or not-so-new, kid on the pay-TV block, is as gut wrenching as the agony a proportion of viewers must have felt while DStv owner MultiChoice toyed with the prospect of adding an adult entertainment channel to its line-up. TopTV launches next month and one could be forgiven for thinking that DStv\\'s rival somehow ran out of marketing budget. Save for a few stories resultant from random media briefings there has been little hype building up to the launch. It begs the question of whether or not the channel is within a whiff of its goal to attract at least 5.5 million subscribers to its services. Interestingly the company armed advertising firm Net#work BBDO with R120 million last year to make sure its name would ring from every corner. At the time, the firm\\'s managing director, Eric D\\'Oliveria, promised: \"We are going to be using all of the communication channels and media platforms in launching the brand. \"The creative campaign will be deployed in digital, above the line, below the line, through the line, in activation, in outdoor channels - across all media platforms.\" Advertising bombardment of such dizzying proportions has not yet been felt. TopTV\\'s Melinda Connor said this week that a teaser print campaign was launched last weekend in Sunday newspapers. \"Radio and television has been running. Billboards are up and about and also branded taxis and buses will soon be seen around town,\" she said. A campaign featuring footballer Steven Pienaar launches next month. Another media briefing will be held tomorrow with a party later on. On Friday at a breakfast former US vice-president Al Gore will confirm his association with the pay-TV station.

      "Eskom has moved to calm critics of its preferential pricing deals by confirming it is renegotiating long-term contracts with an aluminium producer and a mining house. The announcement this week that the electricity utility had two customers on special deals through which they paid less for energy than other industries and consumers, erupted in a row: Cosatu threatening to mobilise its members and the Cape Chamber of Commerce called for a full investigation into the so-called sweetheart deals. The deals were shrouded in secrecy and apparently not disclosed to the National Energy Regulator when Eskom applied for its three-year, 35 percent increase. Eskom officials had told Parliament that its key industrial customers paid lower rates for electricity through special agreements, but that details of these contracts were confidential. Andrew Etzinger, Eskom spokesman, told The Sunday Independent that contrary to recent speculation the utility did not have special contracts in place for all of its 138 large industrial customers. Only two customers, who hold four contracts between them, were still on special pricing agreement contracts. While Etzinger would not name the companies, it was understood that one was BHP Billiton which has contracts for its aluminium smelters at Hillside, Bayside and Mozal in Mozambique, and the other Anglo American for its Skorpion zinc mine in Namibia. The long-term pricing agreements, said Etzinger, were currently under review. Negotiations between the companies and Eskom had started at the end of 2009, shortly after an undertaking by the utility to renegotiate long-term pricing agreements as the country continued to struggle to meet energy demands. He said that at the time of entering into the special agreements, the country had abundant electricity. It was when a concerted effort was being made to attract new industries to South Africa. \"In terms of the aluminium industry, it is common practice internationally for them to enter into long-term agreements with power utilities because the risk of the investment is so large in terms of electricity pricing. So they need surety before they can invest. \"The single-year price determination structure in which the price was decided yearly was in place at the time and did not provide enough surety. They needed greater insight to determine what their investment was likely to yield,\" he said. The multi-year price determinations which give more certainty were only introduced after these deals had been signed. The negotiations, he said, could take some time as this was a \"very complex issue that will require extensive negotiation\". Mamphela Ramphele, chairman of the Technology Innovation Agency, last week wrote in The Sunday Independent that the continuation of the scandalous late apartheid-era multi-decade special pricing agreements amounted to exporting South Africa\\'s precious energy resources to Australia and other destinations where shareholders were benefiting from the cheap electricity fuelling their investments here. \"Such pricing arrangements allow for multinational mining companies like BHP Billiton to import aluminium from Australia and smelt it in South Africa where they use our ridiculously cheap electricity before they re-export it back to Australia for use in various products. In this process South Africa suffers a double loss: precious electricity extracted from burning our finite coal, and industrial development through beneficiation,\" she wrote. Etzinger said other large industrial customers were on the MegaFlex plan. They were charged according to time of use which differed between winter and summer. If a customer was far from the grid, using electricity during winter at the evening peak, they would be charged R1.40 a kilowatt hour. On the opposite end of the scale, if the client was close to the grid and using electricity off-peak in summer the charge would be 14.7c per kWh. In addition MegaFlex and NightSave customers paid fixed transmission and distribution network charges for capacity used, electrification and rural subsidies, a service fee and an administration fee.\n",

      "Article 7:\n",
      "Sister Arwen - she of the defiantly alternative lifestyle - has a severely practical side. Thus, when Winnie Madikizela-Mandela allegedly flipped her lid this week with virulent attacks on everyone from her ex to the Arch, Arwen promptly identified this as the result of media exposure deprivation (that\\'s MED, not MAD, by the way, though the symptoms are somewhat similar). If only darling Winnie had consulted her, Arwen said, she could have provided lessons (at a price) in media management... so much more elegant than \"spin doctoring\", don\\'t you think? \"Look at how \\'Little Julie\\' manages his media profile,\" she murmured. \"Drip, drip, drip wears the stone away.\" (I think she was referring to the heart of my editor, as he imposes ever-earlier deadlines.) \"He doesn\\'t slag off Gwede Mantashe and Vavi Zwelinzima on the same day that he\\'s calling for the nationalisation of Breitling watches and Moët champagne.\" Instead, she noted, \"an issue a day keeps Julie in play\". Facing keen competition from \"The Mouth\" Madikizela-Mandela, the ID\\'s Patricia de Lille decided to remain her usual shy and retiring self, leaving it to sidekick Lance Greyling to ask the World Bank to hold back on the R29 billion loan Eskom wants. That is, until ANC front company Chancellor House pulls out of Hitachi Power Africa, which has the tenders to build the Medupi coal-fired power station and the proposed Kusile station. (Greyling is believed to be either the only other member of the ID apart from \"Thin Lips\" de Lille, or a remote-controlled avatar.) My advice: if Eskom needs money that badly, why doesn\\'t it just borrow from \"Little Julie\"? Then the ANC can pick up its R1bn profit from Chancellor House as the gravy train goes round and round. If \"Thin Lips\" really needs a new bandwagon, she could join the eco-bunnies in their attempts to sabotage our natural, cheap source of power - coal - and demand that we move to hugely unreliable wind/ solar sources. This would have all sorts of interesting results, including cutting employment almost as much as would a nationalised mining industry, a recent pet theme of \"Little Julie\". Then \"Thin Lips\" would have yet more to complain about, without, of course, taking any responsibility (cause and effect not being in many politicians\\' repertoire). Non-pols like you and I, dear reader, concerned more with real-life jobs and ever-rising power bills, can check a recent analysis of the \"greening\" of Spain, which has headed the same way as Germany in a bid to appease tree-huggers. Boffins at Madrid\\'s King Juan Carlos University found that for every \"green\" job flowing from solar subsidies, rather more than two jobs in other sectors were destroyed. All this after the equivalent of R5.56 million had been poured into the creation of each \"green\" job. (As you\\'d expect, Germany was a tad more efficient, spending \"only\" the equivalent of R1.7m to generate each \"green\" job. But I won\\'t hazard a guess at just how far we could go in the other direction if we really, really tried, while allowing the tenderpreneurs and deployees to skim off their percentages.) One final thought about Winnie \"the Mouth\": she was in Alabama, of all places, that quintessential southern state, when the ANC finally thought to contact her to check if she had indeed been \"correctly quoted\". Why there? Clearly because luscious Liza Minnelli got it so right in the song My Mammy, with the lines \"Everything seems lovely, When you start to roam\", but then, as always with Winnie, confusion took over and \"My heart strings a tangle around, Alabama-ammy\". \"Vader Jacob\" Zuma\\'s splendiferous state visit to the former colonial power has already borne fruit. After the topics over which the London gutter press attacked him, it seems appropriate that the first quantifiable goodie should come in the form of aid to buy 42 million condoms before the World Cup. Understandably, \"Vader Jacob\" was concerned about the needs of soccer fans visiting our fair shores for the first time, but I\\'m sorry that the Brits could only see their way to providing this limited quantity, when in fact a total of 1 billion condoms were asked for. Let\\'s hope that he zinged the poncy Poms in the same way that allegedly happened during one of the Allied conferences towards the end of World War II, when Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill used to get together to consider carving up the post-war world. Supposedly, Marshal Joe Stalin used the impending advance of the mighty Red Army into the German heartland to make a special request to US President Franklin D Roosevelt: could the next lot of US aid include about 10 million condoms to protect Stalin\\'s gallant troops from fascist diseases as they \"fraternised\" their way to Berlin. FDR enquired what size the Soviets would prefer, to which Stalin came back: \"The 30cm ones will be adequate, Comrade President.\" Without missing a beat, FDR turned to an aide and said: \"Make a note: 10 million Texas Mediums for our allies.\" I\\'m no great admirer of the two-wheeled wonder, Lance Armstrong. But I like even less the poverty of spirit displayed by presenters and callers alike on a talk radio station this week, chirping about how Armstrong was held up at Cape Town International Airport on Monday night because his passport didn\\'t have enough blank pages. Stuck in limbo, Armstrong tweeted about the hold-up, before finally reporting: \"Well, made it into SA. Not the friendliest welcome I\\'ve ever received but we\\'ve all seen immigration officers like that.\" The sheer nastiness of those on the phone-in show was sad, with mingled envy and hatred added to a sort of \"Who does he think he is\" whinge, plus a dash of \"That\\'ll show the Yanks\". Yes, roolz is roolz, or as the Nazis used to say: \"Ordnung muss sein!\" and \"Befehl ist Befehl!\" to excuse any and all nastiness. Surely in the great scheme of things, cluttered pages in an otherwise valid passport are pretty minor, worthy of \"You\\'ll know next time. Meanwhile, let\\'s see what we can do to get emergency papers. And, by the way, welcome to South Africa.\" In the country of \"maak \\'n plan\", let\\'s stay positive, friendly and helpful. If we don\\'t, many of those hoped-for hordes of soccer fans, for example, are going to leave sadly disappointed.\n",

The SA Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) signed an agreement on Thursday with state-owned Transnet for an 11 percent wage increase and a one-off payment of 1 percent of workers\\' salaries. The deal had added R1 billion to Transnet\\'s wage bill, the company said. \"We\\'ve estimated it will take between 30 and 60 days to clear the backlog,\" Transnet spokesman Mboniso Sigonyela said on Friday. The strike, which started on May 10, forced several companies including Exxaro Resources, ArcelorMittal South Africa, and Xstrata to declare force majeure on metal and coal deliveries, enabling them to miss contracted deliveries. It has cost the country billions of rand, according to the SA Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Most of Satawu\\'s members employed by Transnet had returned to work on Friday, the labour group\\'s general secretary Zenzo Mahlangu said. \"I can say with authority the majority of workers are back to work and are working very hard,\" Mahlangu said. \"By Monday everybody will be back,\" he said. AP Moller-Maersk, some of whose ships had been moored offshore while they waited for the strike to end, would take \"several weeks\" to clear the backlog, spokesman Fred Jacobs said on Friday. Maersk and other shipping lines are charging exporters extra to deliver delayed goods. The country\\'s fruit industry has suffered R1 billion in losses owing to the labour action, according to Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Tina Joemat-Pettersson. South Africa, which produces fruits ranging from grapefruit to plums, is the world\\'s second- largest citrus fruit exporter after Spain. It was \"too early\" to calculate losses at Transnet, Sigonyela said. - Bloomberg\n",

      "As many dedicated couch potatoes have perhaps noticed there has been a reshuffle in DStv\\'s channel line-up to accommodate future channels. Ordinarily this would perk me up but given that one of the world\\'s biggest sporting events is about to kick off (pun intended) in this country, I am inclined to believe that these mystery future channels will be dedicated to covering and unpacking all the ups and downs of the World Cup. It\\'s hard to forget that this event is almost upon us, what with the panoply of flags festooning almost every nook and cranny of Joburg and the reverberations of vuvuzelas you can hear well into the night. It\\'s a hard instrument to play and requires extensive practice to perfect. It\\'s a bit late to be introducing a soccer channel, especially given that legions of footie fans are about to descend on our cities. We could have done with a TV series preparing us for the event. You see, while everyone and their dog has been writing up guides to South African cities and our peculiar patois and mannerisms, there isn\\'t any material that might help locals deal with the influx of so many pesky tourists. It takes a certain kind of patience and sense of humour to deal with folk who arrive in our country harbouring all kinds of misconceptions. Before the World Cup is out, we might be wishing some bright spark had written a book titled A Dummies\\' Guide to Tourists in Africa. Most of us have over the years encountered these kinds of visitors; they are easy to spot at the airport decked in their khaki outfits as they prepare to launch into their own fantasy Out of Africa experience a la Karen Blixen\\'s novel or, conversely, what I call \"Bono\\'s starving-impoverished-bring-a-tear-to-your-eye African adventure\", where visitors get to play the benevolent, empathetic saviours of humankind. Celebrities looking for ways to banish guilty feelings for being paid obscene amounts of dosh for diddly-squat tend to opt for the second African adventure. We know more about the cultures in Europe and America than they do about ours, what with most of television products hailing from those countries. But perhaps the best way to get under the skin of another culture is to view its members in the context of a foreign society - their perception of difference and how such notions define their identity. For this reason, all those British travel shows - of which there seem to be an obscene number on our tellies - featuring the likes of Louis Theroux, Stephen Fry and Paul Merton, are more enlightening of their personalities and worldviews than the places they visit. Of the three it is Fry I find the most endearing. His skew nose very much sums up the manner in which he wears his imperfections on his sleeve. Not that that is unusual for a Brit; they are a terribly self-deprecating bunch who are more at ease criticising themselves than parading around like proud peacocks - like the Yanks. But one should not mistake a Brit\\'s humility as any indication as to how they view their (elevated) position in the world. Although Fry, in his show Stephen Fry In America (BBC Knowledge), appears pretty down to earth, he cannot surrender the notion that he is viewing the world from a position of privilege. It\\'s not just his hoity-toity upper-class accent that gives him the edge. Even in a scene where he goes down a coal mine it is clear that he is there as a curious voyeur and the focus is on how Fry views the experience, rather than what it might be like for those who spend their working lives in those dark subterranean parts. He holds onto his Britishness and what that represents so tightly it prevents him from really experiencing the new environments and cultures he encounters. Really, it\\'s absurd that he does his road trip in America in a black cab. This type of vehicle might be a stereotypical emblem of British culture but it\\'s not really appropriate for long journeys. Besides, isn\\'t doing a road trip around America just a convenient excuse to snap up and drive a cheap, flashy convertible? Fry is also averse to sunshine, thus he speeds through all the sunny cities where beach culture rules, such as Miami. So while he gives the impression that he is up for anything, like checking out a garden where forensic scientists watch human corpses decompose, he only gets involved in quirky activities that conform with this notion of himself as an eccentric and humorous British raconteur. Nevertheless, Fry makes a much better travelling companion than some of his crabby contemporaries, such as Merton, who is so weighed down by cynicism that you wonder why he ever left home at all. Even when Merton finds himself taking a bath in beer on the German leg of his trip he wears a pained expression. Like Fry\\'s series, Merton also hunts down the more quirky attractions in Europe. During a trip to Milan in his Paul Merton in Europe (BBC Knowledge) series he meets a footballer who lives in a clothing store and an unconventional shoemaker who makes art with naked women. Preference for these offbeat attractions gives a skewed view of the continent, establishing it as one full of oddballs. Always with a sardonic comment at the ready, Merton hardly revels in the company of the weirdos he encounters; their enthusiasm cannot penetrate his cool detachment. I suppose the idea is that like most well-travelled Brits, he has seen it all and thus isn\\'t fazed by anything, no matter how preposterous. I wonder what he would make of groups of men wearing makarapas?\n",

      "It\\'s serenely silent as I hike down the canyon walls. The only sounds are the crunch of my boots on the boulders, the occasional twitter of a bird and the gentle tumbling of the river. High above, towering orange cliffs loom, outlined against the deep blue sky. It\\'s a hot morning, so I stop for a swim. The cold water refreshes me instantly and I linger, soothing my muscles. Our group is spread out and I hike on alone, feeling small and insignificant in this vast space. Namibia\\'s Fish River Canyon is a harsh and beautiful place. Purported to be the second largest of its kind in the world after the Grand Canyon in the US, it measures approximately 160km in length, stretching southwards from Seeheim to the Orange River. The five- or six-day hike that penetrates its base is strenuous, winding through 85km of jaw-dropping scenery from the Hobas viewpoint to the spa resort at Ai-Ais. There is no defined path to follow - trailists have to clamber over boulders, climb embankments and trudge through thick sand or across open plains. There\\'s also no set route - using the map as a guide, you simply follow the river. Furthermore, you need to find the short cuts; if you don\\'t, you\\'ll add many hours of hard slogging to the journey. Nights are spent beneath the stars, with groups finding a flat sandy space and rolling out their sleeping bags. You carry your backpack for five days, so it\\'s vital to be well prepared with the barest essentials. Mine included sachets of tuna, cracker biscuits, instant soup and pasta meals, powdered energy drinks, energy bars and a spare gas canister. Instant oats with raisins and honey would do for breakfast, and I added several slabs of Lindt chocolate. Clothing consisted of a few T-shirts, two pairs each of shorts and underwear, a jersey, a sunhat, a beanie, a sarong and tracksuit pants. My biggest problem was my camera gear, which totals 4kg. After squeezing in cooking equipment, medical supplies, a sleeping bag and an inflatable mattress, I was shocked to find that my pack weighed a hefty 23kg. I became ruthless. Out came half my clothing, a few packets of soup, some energy bars and my lens. The weight registered about 18kg. The chocolate stayed. I wake before dawn and leave Cape Town as a violent thunderstorm breaks over the city. I fetch fellow hiker Julian Abramson and we head along the N7 towards Namibia. Just past Springbok the clouds disperse to reveal a bright, sunny day. At the border we negotiate customs with little fuss, and drive across the Orange River. The sun has just set when we arrive at Ai-Ais, where we rendezvous with the other hikers in our party. Everyone is excited and, after a barbecue, we soak in the hot spring water and chat about our forthcoming adventure. The next morning we take the shuttle bus to Hobas, where we pose on the edge of the canyon for the obligatory team photograph. I slap on some sunscreen, do a few stretches and heave on my pack. We descend the precarious path cautiously, negotiating the rocks with care and using the chains secured at the steeper sections. It\\'s very hot. Unaccustomed to the heavy backpack, my hips are hurting like hell. After two knee-jarring hours I reach the river, strip off my clothes and plunge into the water. Lunch is tuna with crackers, a square of cheese and an energy bar. \"Your pack is now about 250g lighter,\" jokes Abramson. We take a short siesta, then walk in the afternoon heat along the stone-strewn banks of the river. The canyon is so still that the silence is deafening. \"This place is amazing,\" he smiles. \"I sat for a moment and it was so quiet that I could hear the insects talking.\" I trudge on slowly through thick sand and over big boulders, stopping every hour for a swim, until the light softens and we reach a wide sandy bank. I ease the load off my aching back and level out a stretch of sand, then unroll my mattress and sleeping bag. The sun sets and a thin band of pink cloud colours the sky. Dinner is leftover steak and sausages from our barbecue last night, followed by rooibos tea with whisky and honey. Before scrambling into my sleeping bag, I rub my limbs with arnica oil to soothe my sore muscles. Despite being tired, I\\'m entranced by the twinkling stars and dark heavens, and fall asleep lulled by the river gurgling and murmuring around the rocks. Day Two dawns cloudy and after a quick cup of tea we set off downriver. The conditions are ideal for hiking and some of the speedsters in our group rush ahead, leaving us dawdling behind, stopping to swim and take photographs. The first two days are spent covering what is considered to be the most rugged part of the trail as it involves plenty of boulder-hopping and plodding through thick sand. Finding that the left bank has become too steep to negotiate, we make the first of many river crossings. One slip could mean a dunk in the river or even broken bones. I walk on alone, enjoying the silence. Suddenly, amid the barren scenery, white lilies bloom from the earth. Fragile footprints of insects and lizards pattern the sand. The ascending sun illuminates the orange cliffs, then appears overhead, glinting on the green water. After two hours we stop for breakfast and Abramson fires up the Cadac cooker to boil some water. Instant oats have never tasted so good. Trekking on, the going becomes tough as we struggle across long stretches of giant boulders and soft sand. We soon learn to read the canyon by watching the curves of the gorge ahead. I fall into the so-called \"Fish River rhythm\" and the hours fly past. The birdlife is plentiful and we watch two grey herons swoop over the river, their cries echoing off the canyon walls. A booted eagle glides gracefully on the thermals, then suddenly flies off in a frenzy. \"It\\'s being chased by a kestrel that probably has a nest in the area and is protecting its chicks,\" says Meidad Goren, the team\\'s birding expert. Hours later, we stop at a small rocky cove for lunch: chicken noodle soup, tuna with oven-dried tomatoes and a herb dressing, with the usual crackers. By late afternoon we still have not caught up with the frontrunners, and we decide to make camp on a wide beach. I wake early the next morning and check my boots for scorpions before pulling them on. Two of our party set off to try to catch the others. We linger over breakfast until the sun strikes the upper canyon walls. I wash the cutlery with sand and water, then heave on my backpack. It definitely feels lighter today. Soon we encounter the stench of sulphur at Palm Springs, where boiling water gushes from the earth. We spend an hour soaking our limbs, but cannot linger too long or we will fall even further behind. Abramson and I trek on past Klipspringer Ridge and as the peaks of the canyon turn gold, we\\'re treated to the majestic sight of three wild horses drinking from the river. We also spot a large monitor lizard before it vanishes under a rock. The sun disappears and we find a perfect site to spend the night. While collecting firewood, we see three of our companions walking on the opposite riverbank. \"We crossed a little way back but it\\'s too deep here for us to come back over,\" they shout. \"We\\'ll camp further down and meet up with you tomorrow.\" Abramson lights the fire and we relax. \"It doesn\\'t get much better than this,\" he says. \"We\\'re sitting beside a crackling fire, under a starry sky, next to a flowing river, with the horses nearby and pasta cooking on the coals. This is paradise.\" We rendezvous with the others in the morning and find a short cut before scrambling down to yet another river crossing. Shadows creep across the folds of the canyon as the sun lights up the land. We pass Dassie Ridge, then negotiate a series of boulder fields and a vast rocky plain. At last, after a tiring 10-hour slog, we camp below towering Four Finger Rock. After dinner we sit around the fire, toasting marshmallows and listening to the distant cries of baboons and jackals. It\\'s the last day and our small group wakes long before sunrise. We still have 25km of hard hiking ahead to reach Ai-Ais by evening and my feet are taking strain. I\\'ve got four big blisters and every step is agony. Nevertheless, as the sun\\'s rays touch Four Finger Rock, we\\'re ready to go. At a tricky river crossing, a few members of our group slip on the rocks. My blisters are really killing me. Others are also suffering and every break turns into a communal first-aid session. I shut my mind to the pain and hike on doggedly. We finally stumble onto the last short cut at 3pm. There\\'s still 12km to go, but we\\'re on the home stretch and I allow my thoughts to turn to the comforts awaiting us at Ai-Ais - clean clothes, a steak, a cold beer. Crossing the river for the final time, I hobble on for the last few kilometres until, as the light softens and the rocks glow gold, we round a corner and spot the campsite. We dump our packs, order beers and jump into the spa\\'s hot water. Our aches and pains are soon forgotten and we pledge to return to this wilderness of water and stone.\n",

      "Squabbles in the mining industry last year put controversial regulatory issues under the spotlight. And, partly as a result of the problems that emerged, foreign investors with long-term plans largely steered clear of South Africa. Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Indonesia and Malaysia were magnets for foreign direct investment (FDI) last year while South Africa nearly fell off the map. Nazmeera Moola, a director at Macquarie First South, believes the country\\'s failure to compete with other emerging markets is largely due to two factors: South Africa lacks a large internal market and its domestic demand is sluggish, compared to some of the larger emerging markets. And investment in resources - the country\\'s major attraction - has been affected by concerns about security of tenure and infrastructure constraints. Against this backdrop, South Africa lost out to its emerging market peers last year. The UN Conference on Trade and Development reported last week that FDI to emerging markets as a whole rose 10 percent to $524.8 billion (R3.7 trillion). South African\\'s share was a miserable $1.3bn as FDI plunged nearly 78 percent. In comparison, Brazil attracted more than $30bn; Chile $18.2bn; Mexico $19bn; Indonesia $12.8bn; and Malaysia $7bn. And it is not just the country\\'s FDI performance that reflects problems in the mining industry. Leon Esterhuizen, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, says South Africa\\'s mining stocks are trading at bigger and bigger discounts to their peer groups. \"And it\\'s not an Africa issue but a South Africa issue,\" he says. \"Mining companies in Ghana, Mali and other countries in West Africa are |trading at a premium to North American mining stocks, but South African companies are trading at a discount.\" Calls by the ANC Youth League\\'s Julius Malema to |nationalise the mines set the tone for the year. But other factors were equally problematic. Esterhuizen cited regulatory uncertainty, escalating power costs and strikes. Roger Baxter, the economist at the Chamber of Mines, says it is difficult for mines to develop new projects because power supply is limited. The mining sector failed to get the most out of the commodity boom, which peaked in mid-2008, because electricity producer Eskom was unable to meet the country\\'s needs. After halting production for several days in January that year, mines were restricted to 90 percent of normal usage for several months. Baxter says many companies had to restructure in 2008, closing down shafts that have never been reopened. Lack of adequate transport is another barrier to investment. Mike SchÃ¼ssler, the chief economist at Economists.co.za, says the problem is particularly acute in the case of bulk commodities like coal. \"Richards Bay can handle 90 million tons of coal a year but Transnet will only be able to achieve that quantum in a few years time.\" Road transport is an expensive alternative, he says. So companies have to absorb extra costs when they can\\'t move their commodities by rail. South Africa\\'s mining industry has been in a state of flux for several years. Major changes came in 2003 with the conversion of old order mining rights to new order rights. But Moola says the change in itself was not a problem. It simply brought South Africa into line with \"international practice\". The problem she says was that it took the then Department of Minerals and Energy several years to process the applications. And investors were only prepared to invest once the transfer was completed. Moreover, \"the way the law was written, a lot was left to the discretion of officials, which created uncertainty\", Moola says. \"Companies thought they had rights and it turned out they didn\\'t.\" Peter Leon, an expert on mining law at attorneys Webber Wentzel, believes Susan Shabangu, Minister of Mineral Resources, is making a determined attempt to deal with the issues of concern. In September, she imposed a six-month moratorium on licences for prospecting, to allow for an audit of licences granted and to develop a new licence process tracking system. Meanwhile, amendments to legislation to clarify the situation are expected this year. But the outcome remains to be seen. In the meantime, investors are left with perceptions that political connectivity is an important factor in striking deals. Transactions that made headlines last year include a high profile deal which involved President Jacob Zuma\\'s son, Duduzane Zuma. Commodity prices started recovering in March 2009, after the 2008 crash in global financial markets. But South Africa\\'s mining response was tentative. After falling by 5.6 percent in 2008, the mining component of gross domestic product (GDP) fell 4.2 percent the following year. However, things are now looking up. In November, mining GDP increased 9.6 percent year-on-year, according to Statistics SA, from 6.5 percent in October. The turning point came in June, after a year-on-year decline of 7.7 percent in the 12 months to May. Perhaps the investment outlook will improve this year - particularly if the regulatory issues are resolved and highly connected businessmen are no longer seen as the first in the queue.\n",

      "South Africa\\'s dependence on the car for transport would be among the government\\'s major challenges as it attempted to wean the economy off fossil fuels, Sir David King, a former scientific adviser to the British government, said on a visit to the country this week. The South African-born academic, who set up and directs Oxford University\\'s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, warned that a combination of peaking oil production capacity and global economic recovery would send oil prices surging to a point where the economies of non-oil producing countries would again falter. \"We\\'ve had a global financial crisis - and I\\'m one of those who believe the global financial crisis was stimulated by the very high oil price of 2007 and 2008 of $150 (R1 053.04) a barrel - followed by a debt crisis... I think we\\'re going to see a second spiral of a global economic downturn,\" he said. \"We\\'ve got all sorts of reasons to move quickly and to think out of the box in terms of how we defossilise our economies. And South Africa has quite a long way to go.\" King, who advises the government of Rwanda and about 100 large international companies on climate change, said South Africa\\'s growth as a \"very high-carbon economy\" with per capita emissions equivalent to those of the UK was due in part to the influx of people into megacities like Johannesburg and Pretoria \"where getting around on foot or bicycle isn\\'t really possible\". As a result, South Africans spent a lot of time in traffic jams or took the choice to arrive at work early. King believed the way forward was to \"rethink our style of living - go right back to square one\". He welcomed the extension of the country\\'s mass transit system, including a high-speed rail link between Johannesburg and Pretoria. A key issue for South Africa would be putting a price on carbon - in the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, he said. The Treasury last month released a discussion paper in which it expressed preference for a modestly-rising carbon tax up to R200 per ton of carbon, although it acknowledged a tax would not set a ceiling for carbon emissions in the short term. It listed a number of concerns with implementing a carbon trading scheme. King said while taxes and cap-and-trade schemes were financially equivalent, a trading scheme with caps |that were \"not sufficiently screwed down\" would not cause the technological switch required for a low-carbon growth trajectory. \"In Britain, the government is now thinking about introducing a carbon tax to supplement the carbon trading products, so that we can put a floor on the carbon price. I think that\\'s absolutely the right way forward,\" said King, who was the head of chemistry at Cambridge University before being appointed the UK government\\'s chief scientific adviser a decade ago. In South Africa, the Treasury\\'s recent carbon tax discussion paper listed a number of concerns with implementing a trading scheme, including the \"oligopolistic structure\" of the local energy sector, which would limit domestic trade in the scheme, lead to inappropriate permit prices and possibly act as a barrier to entry for newcomers. King suggested a trading scheme that brought other southern African nations on board as a solution, but acknowledged that the absence of a unified political system - like that which underpins the EU\\'s emissions trading scheme - would be a hindrance. \"So either you introduce trading between provinces in South Africa, and that may not be feasible, or you go for a tax. And the tax is going to be a much simpler system,\" he said. The selection of the form of carbon tax to implement would be a \"very big question\". The Treasury\\'s discussion paper says an upstream proxy carbon tax would be relatively easy to implement, although a proxy tax on fuel inputs could be considered and levied according to the carbon content of fossil fuels. King said a tax at source was probably more practical, but cautioned: \"The danger is you\\'re simply passing the cost on to the consumer of electricity - whereas if you tax by estimating the carbon content of manufactured goods and so on, you\\'re on much stronger ground. \"But it may also be more difficult for the government to implement... How do you distinguish a manufactured article in terms of whether it\\'s used electricity from hydropower to one manufactured using electricity from coal?\" King advised that countries wait for the lifetime of their high-carbon, large-scale infrastructure facilities to play through as they transitioned to low-carbon modern technology. \"It has to be managed by taking it step by step. Anything that is done should not be done overnight. This is something that can only be done over a period of decades,\" he said.\n",

      "The utilisation of production capacity for November 2010 was 81.6 percent compared with 79.9 percent in November 2009, an increase of 1.7 percentage points. This improvement can mainly be attributed to a decrease in insufficient demand by 1.6 percentage points. The year-on-year decrease in insufficient demand indicates further improvement from the slowdown in the economy that started towards the end of 2008 and was experienced through most of 2009. The manufacturing divisions that reported the largest year-on-year gains in November 2010, were motor vehicles, parts, accessories and other transport equipment division with a contribution of 10 percentage points; electrical machinery division with 3.8 percentage points; wood and wood products, paper publishing and printing division with 2.3 percentage points; basic iron and steel, non-ferrous metal products and metal products and machinery division contributing 1.9 percentage points; and furniture and \\'other\\' manufacturing division, which includes recycling and tobacco products with a contribution of 1.2 percentage points. There were four manufacturing divisions where year-on-year decreases were also prevalent. Of these, the biggest decrease was in the glass and non-metallic mineral products division with |-2.7 percentage points. The decrease in this manufacturing division follows a similar trend to the one observed in the Building Statistics Survey. Other divisions that also reported marked year-on-year declines in utilisation rates include the food and beverages division a -0.7 percentage point and the radio, television and communication apparatus and professional equipment division with a -0.6 percentage point. The declines in these two divisions correlate closely with the production and sales survey. With regard to the annual rate of utilisation of production capacity in the manufacturing industry, comparing the November 2010 utilisation of production capacity figure with August 2010, an increase of 2 percentage points was evident. However, this increase can be attributed more to seasonal factors as November is usually the peak month of the year for manufacturers. More importantly, the increase had inherent base effects, thus marking a recovery from the strike in the automobile industry in August 2010. Electricity generated and available for distribution shows a year-on-year increase of 1.1 percent in actual consumption of electricity in December 2010. For the year 2010, the increase was 3.8 percent compared with 2009, which followed on a decrease of 2.7 percent between 2008 and 2009. Electricity consumption data is a robust indicator of the performance of the manufacturing industry because of the intensive dependence that manufacturing has on electricity, especially the iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical and petrochemical and non-metallic minerals division. According to the latest data available from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa, the manufacturing industry consumes about 38 percent of total electricity available for distribution in South Africa. Data on electricity generation also gives insights into mining production and sales data, specifically coal production data. About 92 percent of South Africa\\'s power is generated by means of coal-fired power stations, therefore there is a high correlation between electricity generation and coal production data. This week I will be releasing the Manufacturing: Production and sales for December 2010, which will be published on Thursday. Furthermore, on Wednesday I will be releasing the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) for the fourth quarter 2010. Pali Lehohla is the statistician-general and the head of Statistics SA\n",

      "Transnet\\'s inability to transport the country\\'s expected maize surplus of 2 million tons due to inadequate rail infrastructure has resulted in a staggering loss of R3.3 billion in potential business for the local grain industry. AndrÃ© Jooste, a senior manager for marketing and economic research at the National Agricultural Marketing Council, said on Friday that the situation in the grain industry was not optimal as the country was unable to export maize to its traditional markets in neighbouring states because they had produced sufficient quantities themselves. He added that if South Africa had produced a surplus over an extended period, it was important to plan how to move goods from one place to the next. \"It\\'s a pity that Transnet can\\'t face the demands.\" He explained that the current situation favoured food security in South Africa and food prices would move to export parity, which would make things less expensive. The challenge was to get to an optimal situation where exports and imports were balanced, he said. Bloomberg reported that South Africa could become Africa\\'s biggest agricultural exporter if there were adequate transport and shipping facilities. \"The country would need to export 350 000 tons of maize a month between May and September,\" the report said. Bloomberg said that white maize was currently trading at R1 627 a ton and yellow maize at R1 679. The lost opportunity for grain producers mirrors the problems facing the coal sector, which is losing export business because of limitations on the Richards Bay coal line. Business Report reported earlier last week that the Richards Bay Coal Terminal\\'s plans for increased export volumes would be put on ice until 2015 because of limited rail infrastructure from Transnet. This has resulted in the coal industry missing out on higher demand from Asian markets. Sandile Simelane, the spokesman for Transnet Freight Rail (TFR), which transports grain for both domestic and export markets, said TFR engaged with the grain industry regularly through a number of initiatives, and also provided customers with regular feedback. \"TFR management also has regular meetings with various grain-related bodies to discuss strategy. This is to ensure that we provide the best service,\" Simelane said. He said that during the past year TFR transported 3.2 million tons of grain, and of that amount 150 000 tons was transported to the Southern African Development Community countries for the same period. TFR, through its capital expenditure programme and quantum leap strategy, was embarking on \"a huge spending spree\" to address challenges across the board. \"This is meant to improve our services to all the commodities. We are also doing our best to optimise the available capacity to rail more tonnages in all the commodities.\" He would not be drawn on how much Transnet was losing in business opportunities due to inadequate transport infrastructure. \"Transnet will soon be announcing its financial statements and the company\\'s plans going forward. More information will be shared then,\" he said, after being asked what strategy the company had to satisfy coal and grain demands. He explained that grain was usually single wagon traffic and not block traffic like coal. It was much easier to execute block load traffic than single wagon traffic, which needed numerous shunts before it ran on a general train to the destination. Coal did not have a higher priority than grain, except that coal, in block loads, was much easier to execute. Lourie Bosman, the DA shadow minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said if the grain industry could produce a surplus, then it was imperative to get into the market. He also expressed concern about the limited facilities that were available to move the grain once a market had been established. Bosman said a solution would be to allow the sector to get into the bio-fuel market, insisting that there was enough land to expand production.\n",

      "The ANC\\'s commitment to armed struggle and the formation of its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, presented Tutu with a tricky dilemma. He abhorred violence. The whole thrust of his prophetic ministry was to campaign and plead for the abandonment of apartheid so as to avoid the racial bloodbath he believed would otherwise engulf his beloved South Africa. Yet he never decried the ANC\\'s armed struggle. This was necessary to retain credibility among the militant youth to whom he was trying to give leadership and guidance. But this was not just an opportunistic attempt to wriggle out of a tight corner. Tutu genuinely believed in, and was able to justify theologically, the principle of a just war in the face of intolerable oppression. \"I will never tell someone to pick up a gun,\" he once said in an attempt to explain the ambiguity of his position, \"but I will pray for the man who picks up the gun, pray that he will be less cruel than he might otherwise have been, because he is a member of the community.\" Careful though he was, it inevitably meant once again that he sailed close to the wind, stopping just short of inviting the capital charge of treason. But, ironically, it was among the militant \"comrades\" that Tutu ran into the most vehement criticism for his position on violence. For all his intellectualising of the legitimacy of a just war, such was his abhorrence of violence, his deep sense of the inherent sanctity of all human life, that he sometimes flung himself with reckless courage into the way of militant mobs intent on wreaking terrible revenge on individuals they regarded as police informers, sell-outs or simply those termed \"system blacks\", performing jobs within the apartheid bureaucracy. The ranks of the broad liberation movement were riddled at the time with informers, often young activists who had been captured and \"turned\" by the security forces - either through torture, the threat of execution or just plain bribery - into spies for the apartheid state and informers on their erstwhile comrades. The security forces called them askaris, to the comrades they were impimpis. This fabricated word has no known linguistic derivation, but seemed to resonate with the special odium of a pimp, with a prefix and suffix added. As far as the comrades were concerned, impimpis had to be killed, and the chosen method of execution in the adrenalised fury of those days was by a cruel method known as necklacing, which involved putting a car tyre around the victim\\'s neck, filling it with petrol and setting it ablaze. On at least two occasions, Tutu, a small and quite frail man, then in his fifties, stopped the executions by plunging into the frenzied crowd and rescuing the intended victim. The first occasion was when Tutu and a colleague, Bishop Simeon Nkoane, came upon a mob attacking a man some accused of being an informer as mourners were leaving the funeral of four comrades who had been killed the previous week in what looked like security force assassinations. Yelling, \"Impimpi! Impimpi!\" the mob beat the man to the ground, doused him with petrol and were about to set him ablaze when Tutu reached the victim and, with Nkoane\\'s help, pulled him away and put him in Nkoane\\'s nearby car. When Tutu admonished the crowd, telling them theirs should be a noble and righteous struggle, they shouted back at him, \"Why don\\'t you let us deal with these dogs the way they treat us?\" The second rescue was at the funeral of a prominent civil rights lawyer, Griffiths Mxenge, who had been butchered by state assassins who hacked him to death with pangas, knives and daggers late at night on a football field in Durban. Mxenge\\'s terrible death aroused intense anger throughout the liberation movement and, again, as mourners left the makeshift platform where Tutu had delivered the funeral oration outside a tiny Eastern Cape hamlet, the cry of \"Impimpi\" went up from the crowd, and a group of youths pounced on a man among them. As they pummelled him to the ground, a tyre appeared seemingly from nowhere. But before it could be slipped around his neck, Tutu burst through the group and flung himself across the bleeding man\\'s prostrate body, calling to the crowd to back off. They withdrew reluctantly and, as Tutu stood up, his cassock stained with the man\\'s blood, he called to aides to carry the man to a car and drive him away. They did so but, later that night, to Tutu\\'s dismay, the avengers tracked the man down and completed their execution. Tutu, appalled by the continuation of necklace killings and frustrated by his inability to stop them, threatened at one point to leave the country if the incendiary comrades did not heed him. The young radicals were unimpressed. \"Let him go,\" a group of them declared after meeting in Soweto to discuss his threat, \"then we can get on with the revolution without him restraining us.\" Tutu again felt the hostility of the youths to his pleas for moderation when he addressed a huge funeral rally of some 45 000 in the Johannesburg township of Alexandra at the height of the violence in February 1986. He had tried to intercede by conveying the community\\'s grievances to the government, and had to report back that the authorities had done no more than undertake to look into their objections. The anger of the crowd was directed at him. For once his sparkling rhetoric failed to stir them. Sullen faces stared at him as he delivered his address and there were even some shouted interruptions. Afterwards a smaller group surrounded him and tried to prevent him from leaving as they bombarded him with questions about how he expected them to redress their injustices. Eventually an aide muscled his way through the crowd and pushed Tutu into a car. The government, meanwhile, continued to accuse him of condoning violence. Yet it was Tutu\\'s advocacy of the seemingly milder issue of economic sanctions and disinvestment that made life even more difficult for him, prompting a furious reaction in the white community and, most painfully for him, disapproval within the body of his own Anglican Church and among his white liberal supporters as well. Such eminent figures as Alan Paton, the celebrated author and leader of South Africa\\'s Liberal Party, and Helen Suzman, who for 13 tough years was the sole human-rights voice speaking out forcefully in the all-white and overwhelmingly male Parliament in Cape Town, opposed him vigorously. \"I do not understand how your Christian conscience allows you to advocate disinvestmentâ€¦\" Paton wrote angrily to Tutu. \"It would go against my deepest principles to advocate anything that could put a man, and especially a black man, out of a job.\" But Tutu was steadfast, insisting that the vast majority of black people would willingly endure such hardships if it would bring an end to the system of apartheid under which they all lived. Tutu triggered this surge of condemnation during a visit to Denmark when he chastised the Danes in a television interview for buying South African coal. When the interviewer asked whether a boycott would not cause black workers to lose their jobs, Tutu replied that such suffering would be temporary, while the suffering caused by apartheid looked as though it was \"going to go on and on and on\". The government went ballistic. Interior minister Alwyn Schlebusch, who was responsible for issuing passports, expressed his \"disgust\" and summoned Tutu to Pretoria to tell him he was guilty of economic sabotage and should retract or apologise. Police minister Louis le Grange delivered a furious speech in Parliament, accusing Tutu of promoting disinvestment, the evasion of military service, labour unrest and furthering the aims and objects of the ANC - all crimes under South Africa\\'s security legislation. President Botha denounced him as \"public enemy number one\" and called on church members to repudiate him. But Tutu remained unrepentant, arguing that economic pressure was necessary to bring about change in the country. When a group of business leaders who were members of the Anglican Church met with Tutu to remonstrate with him, he listened carefully and then - according to the Reverend Njongonkulu Ndungane, who was the church\\'s public relations officer at the time and later Tutu\\'s successor as Archbishop of Cape Town - responded with a challenge of his own: \"If you can tell me of an alternative non-violent strategy that will bring an end to apartheid,\" he said, \"then I will abandon my commitment to sanctions and go round the world pursuing your approach until we reach our goal. But if you cannot, then I will stick with sanctions.\" According to Ndungane, the businessmen had nothing to suggest. For several years, egged on by sustained vilification from the right-wing press and the pro- government national broadcasting service, Tutu was the subject of blind hatred in the mainstream white population. He received abusive phone calls and death threats. Crude graffiti appeared on walls. One day a group of right-wing extremists wearing crash helmets burst into his office, yelled abuse at him and flung 30 silver coins at his desk. A special dirty tricks unit of the state security service, called the Strategic Communications (Stratcom), started a smear campaign through pamphlets and planting of whispered slanders to members of the pro-government media - culminating in a bizarre operation when Stratcom agents hung the foetus of a monkey outside Tutu\\'s home in an apparent attempt to make supposed superstitious township folk think he was under some kind of witchcraft spell. In fact, all it did was bemuse them. The hate campaign reached a climax on 31 August 1988 when President Botha ordered his most ruthless special operations unit to bomb the building housing the South African Council of Churches (SACC) headquarters, called Khotso house (House of Peace), in downtown Johannesburg. The bombing, carried out at night, destroyed the multi-storeyed building but fortunately injured no one. Moreover, Tutu had left the SACC by that time and was serving as Archbishop of Cape Town, but the fact that the head of state had gone to such lengths as to personally order so dramatic an attack reflected the visceral hatred he and his government felt for Tutu and the organisation he had mobilised to arouse the conscience of the world against what they bluntly called the \"evil\" of apartheid. n From \\'Tutu: The Authorised Portrait\\' by Allister Sparks and Mpho A Tutu, published by Pan Macmillan South Africa in association with PQ Blackwell.

      "Did you know that you don\\'t need electricity to watch a movie. Greenpeace, an environmental organisation has made this possible with the first solar powered tent which will change the way we view movies during Cop17. This is part of an energy evolution drive that the environmentalist\\'s will be involved in during the conference. The white solar powered tent which arrives in Durban this week, will be situated at North Beach near the Amphitheatre and will screen environmental documentaries focusing on climate change and renewable energy solution exhibitions. Shoana Hutton, the solar cinema co-ordinator told the Tribune more about what the public can expect. \"Inspiring documentaries on climate change and its impacts on African countries will be screened. A look at the world\\'s second largest forest through pictures and documentaries and poems from the DRC will also be showcased,\" said Hutton. The tent premiÃ¨res on November 28, and screening begins at 10am everyday during COP17 and will be open to the public at no charge. \"We are hoping to inform the public to use solar and wind powered energy and encourage them to change from using dirty coal and dangerous nuclear energy,\" said Andrew Orpen, the renewable solution co-ordinator. According to Orpen, the venue will be powered by 12 solar panels and four wind turbines charging a battery bank which will power all the appliances in the tent. \"The 4.5 by 3.5 screen projecting images and four large television LED screens will be powered by renewable energy,\" said Orpen. Greenpeace will have an online petition in which they will encourage the public to sign to persuade government to use more renewable energy. A celebrity cooking demonstration using solar powered equipment will be among the activities but Orpen wouldn\\'t say which celebrities would be hosted. When asked about what the organisation will do on rainy days he said, \"We will use the wind to power the appliances and viewing will continue inside the tent.\" - Amanda Khoza\n",

      "ONE of the world\\'s most extreme cases of climate injustice happens to be the site for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties 17 (COP17) climate summit. According to our government\\'s National Climate Change Response White Paper: \"potential impacts on South Africa in the medium- to long-term are significant and potentially catastrophic\" for, under conservative assumptions, \"after 2050, warming is projected to reach around 3 to 4Â°C along the coast, and 6 to 7Â°C in the interior\". Still, put aside banal \"Working together, saving tomorrow today\" spin-doctoring. Instead, ask whether the COP17\\'s certain failure to cut greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent by 2020 and 90 percent by 2050 - as scientists tell us is required and as was shunned in 16 prior meetings largely thanks to big-power sabotage - will also be catastrophic for South Africa\\'s ruling party and ruling class. Superficially, an easy gut response is no - for otherwise, why give the COP17 presidency to Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, who less than four months ago revealed her commitment to the planet by hiring a R240 000 executive jet to take her from Norway to Bulgaria when she refused to board a commercial flight which required that her handbag go through the Oslo airport metal-detector, as for all such dignitaries? Such frivolity appeared again when Nkoana-Mashabane ignored applications for the Dalai Lama\\'s visa, as far back as June, so he could attend last month\\'s celebration of Archbishop Desmond Tutu\\'s 80th birthday party - reminding us of the same situation 30 months earlier when Beijing proudly announced Pretoria was under its thumb. Accusing Nkoana-Mashabane of being \"very economical with the truth\", Tutu announced: \"Our government is worse than the apartheid government, because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government. \"Hey Mr Zuma, you and your government don\\'t represent me. You represent your own interests.\" The COP17 host\\'s \"own interests\" appear to be grounded in the crony-capitalist \"minerals-energy complex\", in which Zuma\\'s family has been dabbling, in the process exhibiting extreme environmental irresponsibility as witnessed by a nephew\\'s and legal adviser\\'s destruction of the Aurora mines and surrounding environs. Although Pretoria claims a desire for the Kyoto Protocol\\'s extension after 2012, this appears a rhetorical gambit to bait-and-switch on the other African delegates, now holed up at the Hilton, because satisfying both Washington and Beijing also ensures our own elites\\' prosperity. If PresidentJacob Zuma\\'sgovernment really cared about his closest historical constituencies in rural KwaZulu-Natal villages, who are among those most adversely affected by worsening droughts and floods, then it would halt the |R250-plus-billion-worth of coal-fired electricity generators being built by Eskom at Medupi and Kusile. The state would also shut the world\\'s single largest CO2 emissions source, Sasol\\'s Secunda plant, which makes oil from coal, and also reverse the R80 billion heavy oil refinery authorised for construction at Coega, north of Port Elizabeth. It would reverse its trillion-rand nuclear energy fantasy and deny approval to 40 proposed new coal mines in Mpumalanga, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal allegedly needed |to supply the plants and export markets in coming years, on the grounds that these will cause permanent contamination of rivers and water tables, increased mercury residues and global warming. Pretoria would offer a Just Transition package to all affected workers, transforming their thousands of lost jobs in fossil fuel industries into employment in renewables, public transport, building refurbishment, appropriate production and disposal, reformed agriculture, healthcare and education, as demanded by labour, environmentalists and communities in the Million Climate Jobs campaign. No, aside from minor PR embarrassment when Greenpeace nails Kusile or Earthlife points out Eskom and Sasol reps on its COP17 delegation, Zuma\\'s government doesn\\'t care, as witnessed in the blatantly corrupt ANC deal with Hitachi to supply boilers to Medupi and Kusile, a multimillion-rand bonsela approved by former environment minister, Eskom chair and ANC finance committee member, Valli Moosa. As both victim and villain, SA is a poster-child for elite mismanagement of the climate threat. A good measure of our economic elites\\' addiction to fossil fuels is carbon intensity per capita unit of output, and we have among the world\\'s highest, far worse than even that great climate Satan, the US. An insignificant contribution to the energy grid - less than 4 percent in 2010 - comes from SA\\'s incredible renewable potential in solar, tidal and wind sources. Instead, electricity produced by burning filthy coal is cross-subsidised so it is the cheapest available anywhere in the world for the world\\'s largest mining and metals corporations, BHP Billiton and Anglo American Corporation. Their smelters were revealed in 2010 to be paying less than R0.15/kilowatt-hour thanks to \"special pricing agreements\". The NGO Earthlife squeezed that data from Eskom via the Access to Information Act, now surely impossible thanks to Parliament\\'s Secrecy Bill passage last week. Other large corporations received electricity in 2009 at R0.40/kWh, still the world\\'s lowest price - and although rates have soared dramatically, to more than R1/kWh for many small pre-paid meter household consumers, the lowest increases were imposed on the biggest firms, locked in ultra-cheap for BHP Billiton and Anglo by 40-year apartheid-era deals cut just before 1994. Worse, these are not SA companies reinvesting in our economy, for the main metals/mining firms export their profits both through illegal transfer pricing - a general practice costing us a fifth of GDP in 2007, according to a recent Wits study - and through straight repatriation of dividends to shareholders in London (Anglo) and Melbourne (BHP Billiton). And SA internal consumption of their metals is constrained due to notorious local over-pricing. Meanwhile, millions of poor people are regularly disconnected or denied access to the grid due to extreme poverty, affecting nearly half the country\\'s families. Warfare is under way against municipalities and Eskom in the form of ubiquitous \"service delivery protests\" whose recent root causes in high-priced electricity can be traced to climate change via the bill for Medupi/|Kusile construction, controversially financed by the World Bank\\'s largest-ever loan. The bank claims Medupi will help the poor, once again standing reality on its head. Moreover, because of backsliding from clean electricity to dirty household energy like coal, wood or paraffin, the passage from HIV-positive to full-blown Aids status is rapid via respiratory-related opportunistic infections, including the raging TB epidemic, especially affecting women exposed to particulates when cooking over biomass. In addition to these factors, the ANC government contributes to climate injustice via convoluted global geopolitics. Tellingly, Zuma joined the US, Brazil, India and China as co-sponsors of the Copenhagen Accord in December 2009. The Copenhagen gambit meant that the World Trade Organisation\\'s notorious divide-and-rule politics - endorsed to Africa\\'s dismay by SA trade minister Alec Erwin at the 1999 Seattle, 2001 Doha and 2003 CancÃºn summits but vetoed by the African delegation at the first and third - would become the norm for UN climate negotiations. Another UN process, the High-Level Advisory Group on Finance, included SA Planning Minister Trevor Manuel. Last November, Manuel suggested making up to half the anticipated North-South climate financing - supposedly, $100 billion a year by 2020 - available via the stuttering carbon markets. Manuel was named co-chair of the transitional committee to design the Green Climate Fund in March, and against other countries\\' wishes he ruled the World Bank could continue as fund trustee even though that violates UN conflict-of-interest rules. Meantime, the price of pollution in the European carbon markets favoured by Manuel fell from a high of more than e30 a ton in 2006 to less than eight this week, with Zurich\\'s UBS bank last week predicting a coming low of e3 a ton. Not only do carbon markets avoid the North\\'s needed emissions cuts and energy transformation, they are subject to the kind of fraud, gaming and extreme volatility we have come to expect from financiers. Would you want control of the world economy by the likes of Goldman Sachs - repeated violator of even deregulated financial laws in the wild-west US - to extend, now, to our planet\\'s survival? If so, you will more honestly change the COP acronym to \"Conference of Polluters\", and revise your slogan to clearly reflect Pretoria\\'s interests: \"Warming together, stealing tomorrow today\". n This is an excerpt from Patrick Bond\\'s new book, \\'The Politics of Climate Justice\\', published last week by the University of KwaZulu-Natal Press\n",

      "That was why a legally binding agreement setting targets for the immediate reduction of carbon emissions, as well as the finalisation of a Green Climate Fund agreement were essential at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\'s 17th Conference of Parties. Creating a Green Climate Fund and ensuring long-term funding for mitigation and adaptation in the developing world has been vital not only to ensure communities did not suffer food and water shortages or have their lives claimed by climatic changes in future, but also for the development of technology and skills to come up with alternate ways of providing the services and development needed without increasing carbon emissions. Despite South Africa being the 13th highest carbon emitter in the world, particularly because of its reliance on coal-based power supply, Africa is the lowest contributor to climate change. But, it is to be the hardest hit. It was for this reason that hosting COP17 on African soil was important, said Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa. \"We are highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as rain-fed agriculture. Combined with the severe development challenges the continent already faces, this makes Africans particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,\" she said. The World Bank\\'s Andrew Steer emphasised that climate change was about poverty reduction. \"Developing countries will bear three-quarters of the negative impact of changing weather patterns, water shortages, and rising sea levels, and they are the least equipped to deal with them. \"Hard won gains in poverty reduction are at serious risk. This is no longer just tomorrow\\'s problem. Impacts are being felt today,\" he said. In a recent World Bank blog, Steer said four out of five countries that the Bank worked with listed climate change among the top priorities for their anti-poverty plans. In the past 12 months, nearly 90 percent of country assistance strategies requested by developing countries, and approved by the World Bank\\'s Board, listed climate change as one of the major pillars for World Bank support. Figures showed that the average African generated about 13 times less greenhouse gases than his counterpart in North America. Molewa said without an overriding mitigation and adaptation agenda, the continent may see these figures rise in years to come, as development and population rates grow. \"Africa needs to embark on a path of sustainable development with new, clean, appropriate technologies and to build climate resilient communities, so as to avoid the environmental mistakes of the developed world,\" she said. Part of South Africa\\'s contribution to a cleaner development agenda has been the publication of the Climate Change Response White Paper which targets sectors such as health and agriculture for green development, the signing of an agreement with European governments and the European Investment Bank through which the South African Renewables Initiative (SARi) aimed to \"scale-up and secure long-term funding to enable the growth of the renewable energy industry in South Africa\". Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies also announced South Africa would source more goods locally. The UN report - \"A Brief for Policymakers on the Green Economy and the Millennium Development Goals\" (MDGs) - stated that investing in clean energy, sustainable transport, forests and environmentally-friendly agriculture were essential, if internationally-agreed goals to reduce poverty were to be achieved. The report, reviewing the implementation progress five years before the MDG deadline of 2015, made it clear that environmental degradation was making it more difficult for governments to achieve MDGs. This included improving maternal health, providing safe drinking water and combating hunger and disease. Conversely some countries and communities were finding that environmental improvements, catalysed by deliberate policy choices; smart investments and often private sector partnerships can be a big part of the solution, the study found. Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), said there was rapidly growing evidence that accelerating a transition to a low carbon, resource efficient, employment-generating Green Economy may not only be the key to meeting sustainability challenges of the 21st century, but also provide a considerable contribution to meeting other MDGs. \"On current trends it is likely that achieving all the MDGs by 2015 will be missed. In part because the responses so far have been embedded in a 20th century approach to a new century\\'s challenges,\" he said. The Green Economy, he added, put a fresh lens on the challenges and a spotlight on the multiple cost-effective economic and social opportunities from investing and re-investing in modern clean-tech energy systems up to natural resource management of the planet\\'s ecological infrastructure. \"In doing so, it addresses the economic, social and environmental objective of sustainable development and underscores the wealth of choices and options for sustained progress that meets the realities of our time,\" he said. The report underlined that the environmental goods and services that underpinned the global economy - and, in particular, the GDP of the poor - were shrinking at a rapid rate. The loss of ecological infrastructure, it said, was not only undermining the MDG on environmental sustainability, but also all of the other MDGs and their associated targets. The loss of forests, which were key sources of drinking water and nutrients for agriculture while providing essential goods such as wild foods and medicines, affected the MDGs on hunger and health, and the target of halving the number of people without access to drinking water. While there was no specific MDG for energy, the report stated that providing clean energy underpinned the success of many of the goals, both directly in terms of sustainable development and indirectly if climate change, linked to the burning of fossil fuels, was left unaddressed. One way of financing the achievement of the MDGs was through re-directing subsidies.\n",

      "South Africa should be looking at spreading its sources of energy, including wind, solar and shale gas, as its energy needs were likely to double in the next 20 years, according to Tulsi Tanti, whose India-based wind turbine supplier Suzlon is investing heavily in a wind-energy plant outside Cookhouse in the Eastern Cape. The R2.5 billion project has been announced by Suzlon in partnership with developer African Clean Energy Developments (ACED) and the African Infrastructure Managers - a company held by Old Mutual Investment Group South Africa and Macquarie Capital and AFPOC. Working closely with its partner, the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa and with its appointed mandated lead arrangers - Standard Bank and Nedbank - the ACED finalised a financing package, which Suzlon says \"notably includes a significant portion of broad-based black economic empowerment (BEE) ownership\". The Cookhouse Wind Farm Community Trust - representing communities from the Cookhouse, Somerset East and Bedford areas - will own 15 percent of the plant. Tanti, the chairman of Suzlon, who was visiting Cape Town last week after meeting South Africa\\'s Energy Minister Dipuo Peters at the World Economic Forum at Davos last month, said for each 100 megawatts of electricity it was believed that at least 20 jobs were created, including two permanent jobs and about 18 indirect jobs. During the construction of each wind turbine - of which there will be 200 built - one or two jobs would be created and up to 18 for every 100MW of installed generating capacity. Suzlon - the world\\'s fifth largest wind turbine manufacturer- has been awarded a contract to supply 2.1MW turbines. Up to 200 wind turbines will be erected on an incremental basis over the next two years with the first sods been turned in April. Initially the turbines will be imported from Suzlon\\'s plant in Pune - near Mumbai - in India, while the blades will be imported from the US and the towers from Europe. Tanti said it was envisaged that the construction of the towers and blades would take place in SA. He said this project had the potential to employ 1 000 engineers. \"We intend to source our engineers locally,\" he said, noting that the training would be done at appropriate local training institutions. Tanti said South Africa needed more energy and thousands of decent and sustainable \"green\" jobs. The wind energy sector was well positioned to deliver both of these requirements, he believed. \"We bring to the table our reliable technology and operating experience from 32 countries and are confident that South Africa will see significant growth in this space in the decades to come.\" It was envisaged that the electricity produced at the wind plant at Cookhouse would feed into the national electricity grid administered by Eskom, he added. Tanti said that, at present, wind energy was more expensive to produce than coal-fuelled electricity in SA, although cheaper than gas fuelled electricity. However, as the wind plants expanded economies of scale would bring down the cost of wind energy. Former City Power managing director Silas Zimu will head the Suzlon office in Johannesburg, but the company would also have a sales presence in Cape Town. \"As a group we are committed to local empowerment and to enable environmental, ecological and sustainable growth. Cookhouse is a fantastic first project to turn that vision into a welcome realit,\" he said.\n",

      "THE North West Health Department has launched an investigation into the supply of coal to its hospitals after complaints that it is substandard, overpriced and being ordered incorrectly. If the allegations prove true, then the department is spending millions extra on coal - paying premium prices for poor-quality coal which sources say is damaging hospital boilers. An internal audit unit has been appointed to head the probe. Aside from paying premium prices for substandard coal, the audit unit will also probe allegations that hospitals are not following the correct supply chain management procedures to order, deliver and pay for coal supplied. There are also allegations of|collusion between suppliers and hospital staff, as some companies were hired by the hospitals despite not having the correct tax clearance certificates. They are also looking into allegations that hospitals are receiving less coal than what they have ordered. Provincial health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane admitted there had been several complaints in recent years about the quality and quantity of coal which was being delivered to hospitals. \"The department has asked the provincial internal audit to look into these complaints and action will be taken as appropriate,\" Lekgethwane said. As a result of a complaint by a \"rival supplier\", a sample of coal delivered to one of the hospitals had been taken for testing, he added. The Sunday Independent understands that the department last year spent more than R4 million in just six months ordering coal for three of the five hospitals in one of its four districts. Twelve North West hospitals have boilers which use coal for energy generation, heating and laundry. Hospitals order between 100 and 400 tons a month. The Sunday Independent has seen quotations from March 2012, showing that hospitals were offered coal at R1 300 a ton. If a hospital only orders 100 tons at that price monthly, they would spend about R1.5m on coal a year. If all 12 ordered the minimum of 100 tons, it would cost the province R18.7m. But a source in the coal industry, who asked not to be named, because he does work for the government, said the coal price would fluctuate depending on prices from the mines. Also, hospitals are likely to order more coal during winter. Another source in the hospital\\'s workshops, who spoke to The Sunday Independent on condition of anonymity, says suppliers are overcharging the hospitals by delivering B or C-grade coal, instead of the pricier A-grade product hospitals are paying for. The coal industry source held the same view, saying the government was being cheated out of millions. And they say the lower-grade coal has damaged hospital boilers, resulting in the department paying out several million rand for repairs. The department\\'s budget estimates from last year show it spent more than R8.5m on the repair and maintenance of its boilers across the province. The department\\'s probe comes as it deliberates over a tender to supply coal to the four regions. It is the first time in five years that a tender has been advertised. Senior officials in the department have allegedly been flouting the Public Finance Management Act and Treasury regulations, which call for procurement worth more than R500 000 to be put out to tender. Instead, suppliers have been appointed on a monthly quotation system which is rotated. The tender, which was due to close on August 17, has, however, been extended until October 22. But the department is adamant the quotation system is in line with all prescripts. Lekgethwane said there was nothing untoward with the extension of the tender. The department had cancelled a 2007 tender because the supplier was unable to deliver. Lekgethwane said the department had taken over the managing of the contract from the Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport, previously responsible for boiler maintenance. \"It took a while before the department could get appropriate specifications for the tender to be advertised,\" he said. \"There is not a rotation system in the department. At any time that there is the need for coal supply, quotations are asked from suppliers and appropriately adjudicated. What the hospitals have been guarding against is giving the work to only one supplier to the exclusion of all others,\" he said. Lekgethwane denied that sub-standard coal was destroying hospital boilers. \"Maintenance of boilers is an on-going exercise especiallyâ€¦ [in] old hospital establishments like ours. It cannot be definitively said that the maintenance is due to the poor quality,\" he said. But a source, who works in the workshop at one of the hospitals and could not be named, as he is not allowed to speak to the media, confirmed that part of the boilers\\' problems was caused by the quality of the coal. \"The type of coal is not good. Sometimes the suppliers send us [coal] peas that are too big. Those do not burn properly inside the boilers, which then doesn\\'t reach the proper temperatures.\" He said management knew about the problem, but nothing was being done.\n",

      "Business has had mixed reactions to PresidentJacob Zuma\\'sState of the Nation address saying that while it welcomed the continued focus on infrastructure development, there were areas of concern. The SA Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sacci) said they would have liked to have seen more focus on small and medium enterprises in the State of the Nation speech. Sacci\\'s chief operating officer Peggy Drodskie said the organisation applauded Zuma\\'s tackling of the health, education and skills development issues. But she said, it would have liked more detail on small and medium enterprises. \"We would have liked to have seen some statement on how the environment in which they work would be improved.\" One of the areas the organisation had hoped Zuma would focus on was the issue of violent strikes that have dealt a heavy blow to business confidence over the past year. Drodskie said they welcomed Zuma\\'s focus on violent strikers. In his speech, Zuma said he had \"instructed the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster to put measures in place, with immediate effect, to ensure that any incidents of violent protest are acted upon, investigated and prosecuted. Courts will be allocated to deal with such cases on a prioritised roll. The law must be enforced and it must be seen to be enforced - fairly, effectively and expeditiously. \"We fully stand behind the rights of labour to protest but some of the protests over the last year, particularly since Marikana have been very damaging to South Africa\\'s reputation, particularly for foreign investment.\" In response to Zuma\\'s confirmation that mines would not be nationalised but that the government was investigating royalty agreements, the SA Chamber of Mines\\' chief executive Bheki Sibiya carefully noted: \"In the spirit of stakeholder partnership we look forward to being invited to contribute towards this research to ensure that its outcomes are fully informed to improve the tax regime. \"The mining industry is already making significant contributions in taxes and makes further contributions through royalties on super profits. We are hopeful that the research will make recommendations that will ensure an equitable tax system for all sectors of the economy.\" Sibaya also praised the government for the R860 billion committed to infrastructure projects, saying they were particularly positive about the move from road to rail transportation for coal. \"We are pleased that the Majuba rail coal line will begin soon and hope that its construction will be completed within targeted time frames.\" Adcorp labour economist Loane Sharp said the threat of rising taxes and the possible impact on small businesses were his greatest concerns stemming from the speech. \"My first reaction is to the threat of rising taxes. The president indicated that expenditures and taxation would be looked at and, if necessary, taxes would need to rise. That is very concerning because 1 percent of taxpayers shoulder 25 percent of income taxes at present and any further increases in taxes for this group would lead to widespread tax evasion,\" he said. \"Already small businesses are disappearing into the informal sector at an alarming rate - 440 000 of them stopped reporting their incomes to the authorities after 2006, so that is a very concerning development.\" He also questioned the ANC\\'s continued political alliance with trade union Cosatu. \"That alliance is the biggest single obstacle to job creation in the country. Cosatu-aligned trade unions have usurped authority in the health, education, policing and municipal sectors with disastrous results,\" he said. \"The public sector unions represent a grave risk to South Africa\\'s long-term employment prospects.\" Founder and chairman of the Sekunjalo Group Iqbal SurvÃ© described Zuma\\'s State of the Nation address on Thursday as a nuts and bolts approach that would take the country \"back to basics\". Detailing the positive aspects of the speech, SurvÃ© said it was clear that infrastructure development would continue, \"which is good for business\", and that it had been clearly established that mining would not be nationalised. He said the speech acknowledged the difficulties of the past few months, such as Marikana and the farmworkers\\' strike, and was a \"good way of tackling the root causes of these problems\". However, he said he would have liked to have seen more support for entrepreneurs, and how the jobs fund would be used to ensure growth in entrepreneurship. Recently appointed on to the government\\'s Jobs Fund Committee, SurvÃ© said this was an area he would be focusing on. He would also liked to have seen more on growing the green economy and sustainability, he said. \"In business we tend to see the government as solving problems but we as business also need to come to the party.\" SurvÃ© said on his visit to Davos for the World Economic Forum he had come across many South Africans from the business and government sphere who were saying the same thing. \"What we\\'re saying to people is that South Africa is good. We\\'re not as bad as it looks on TV; we\\'re not a basket case. We\\'re saying don\\'t just come to South Africa as a tourist, rather partner with us.\"\n",

      "Mozambican army clashes with former rebels may disrupt coal shipments and public transportation without heralding a return to civil war, said analysts such as Alex Vine, head of the African program at Chatham House. The Mozambique National Resistance, known as Renamo, said it was ending the 21-year-old peace agreement with the southern African nation\\'s ruling party after army troops captured its headquarters in the Gorongosa mountains on Oct. 21. The action followed Renamo attacks on arms depots and buses this year that killed several people and forced the closing of rail lines used by coal mines owned by Rio Tinto. \"The markets are concerned â€” adds additional risk for lenders and could make it more difficult for Mozambique to raise funds for infrastructure if this drags on,\" London-based Vines said yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions. \"The coal mining companies have also seen their costs rise.\" Renamo fought a 17-year civil war against the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, until signing a peace agreement in Rome in 1992. It has served as the main opposition party for two decades without threatening Frelimo\\'s hold on the presidency and parliament. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama\\'s electoral support dropped to 16.4 percent in 2009 from 47.7 percent a decade before. \"The leadership of Renamo is making a last-minute desperate attempt to get concessions from the Frelimo government,\" Robert Besseling, senior Africa Analyst at IHS Country Risk, said in phone interview from Johannesburg. \"They know that this is the end for them.\" Fueled by transportation, communications, the world\\'s largest discovery of natural gas in the past decade and coal mining operations run by Rio Tinto and Vale, Mozambique\\'s $15 billion economy is expected to expand 7.4 percent this year, according to government forecasts. The former Portuguese colony plans to open a liquefied natural gas terminal in 2018 that will be the second-largest export site in the world after Ras Laffan in Qatar. Anadarko Petroleum and Eni are among companies investing in gas production in the country. \"The primary risk to gas development will be elevated risk perceptions,\" Mark Rosenberg, an Africa analyst for New York- based Eurasia Group, said in an emailed response to questions. \"Given the geography of the nascent gas infrastructure and that Renamo cannot sustain a wide-ranging or prolonged insurgency, physical risks from recent events are quite low.\" State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf Wednesday urged both sides to \"take steps to move back from the brink.\" Pursued by the army, Dhlakama is now holed up in the central province of Sofala, close to his bush strongholds during the civil war. Support from the former white-minority governments in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and South Africa that backed Renamo during the conflict has ended. \"It\\'s only in a very small area of Mozambique where Renamo still has a presence and a fighting capability,\" Besseling said. \"It does not have the capability to stage large-scale attacks on the military.\" Dhlakama is ready for talks with Frelimo and believes the government must \"show signs of detente\" so that he can appear in public, Lourenco do Rosario, rector of the Politechnic University of Mozambique, said yesterday in an interview after meeting with a Renamo delegation in the capital, Maputo. He\\'s criticized President Armando Guebuza\\'s government for allegedly politicizing state offices and for setting up an electoral system that favors Frelimo. With general elections set for October next year, there\\'s no indication that Frelimo is prepared to make concessions. \"Serious gas players will expect a certain amount of political jockeying around resources in the run-up to local and then national elections,\" John Smelcer, director of Africa Mining & Energy Projects at the Johannesburg-based law firm, Webber Wentzel, said yesterday in an e-mailed response to questions from Maputo. \"They also likely understand that Renamo is no longer capable of projecting a serious threat across the country.\" - Washington Post and Bloomberg\n",

      "Article 116:\n",
      "Forget the State of the Nation address, worry about how to address the problem of a nation in a state over red overalls, jammed signals and riot police in the National Assembly. The EFF, led by Julius Malema, former leader of the ANC Youth League, did not care that this address marked the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Freedom Charter. That nonchalance is curious, considering that the expulsion of Malema from the ANC can be traced, among other things, to his persistent calls for the nationalisation of mines, in line with the provisions of the Freedom Charter. The red berets were not interested in President Jacob Zuma\\'s quoting recent StatsSA figures that 15.3 million people were in employment. They were not there to listen to him share his administration\\'s nine-point plan to create jobs, including: the beneficiation of mineral wealth and the dedication of 30 percent of the public procurement budget to supplies by SMMEs, co-operatives and township enterprises. His commitment to giving Eskom R23bn in the next fiscal|year, and the expected long-term 15 000 megawatts that could come from the Grand Inga hydropower project, did not strike a chord with the party that has brought more action to Parliament than any other in the history of South Africa. He could have promised them the world. They would not have believed a word. To them, the president is not \"going to come back... but disappear after the State of the Nation address\". In Malema\\'s words, the \"man cannot be trusted... he must resign\". Lesson? People in power, be careful what sort of youth you raise in your ranks. Condemn their actions when they insult others to make a point while they are among your ranks. If you do not, they will turn on you when they run out of people to affront and, while they are at it, reduce the State of the Nation address to a freak show of water cannon and scuffles. After all, how long before mining is truly transformed? The fracas that preceded the address obliterated from memory the biggest mining show to come to town, a few blocks from Parliament. Thousands of delegates spent three days networking, discussing and making deals in mining. Minister of Mineral Resources Ngoako Ramatlhodi did his best to reassure investors that the mining sector was becoming more attractive. In his address, Zuma reiterated that the monitoring of compliance by mining companies with the Mining Charter was continuing. Of more interest was his decision to refer the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act back to Parliament because of its perceived constitutional shortcomings. Among the key criticisms of the act was the concern that its proposed designation of certain minerals as strategic resources might be in violation of South Africa\\'s obligations to the World Trade Organisation\\'s stipulations. A week ago in Addis Ababa, the AU recommended that Africans find sustainable ways to manage the continent\\'s resources, including beneficiation and adding of value to minerals. Backtracking on the declaration of certain minerals as strategic reflects a lack of the resolve in dealing with an issue that is holding Africa back. We export raw minerals cheaply and import the same minerals in a processed form. Investors prefer certainty. They would rather receive the bad news, deal with it and move on, than legislative and policy processes that in the end skirt the issues. The slump in commodity prices can only mean a rise in private equity deals in mining this year. While those looking for mining assets to buy are excited by their prospective finds, the interests of the communities affected by African\\'s mining activities remain pegged to the vagaries of the international prices of resources over which they have no control. It is time South Africa took a stand on this matter once and for all. Gold in Namibia, graphite in Mozambique, and what with the South Sudanese prospects? Events such as the mining indaba this week tend to raise all sorts of unlikely headlines about the industry. Even as South Sudan is making headlines for its attempts to make something out of the power-sharing deal, I read reports that its Minister of Foreign Affairs, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, was at the Cape Town International Convention Centre talking about mining in his country. A country that is 98 percent dependent on oil has to find alternative sources of revenue, more so when its leadership crisis and squabbles with its northern neighbour make it hard to generate oil revenues. Apparently, before his fallout with his deputy, President Salva Kiir had been visiting Arab countries to raise investments for the sector. In his position, I would first rush to restore leadership and parliamentary order to Juba before talking about mining in Cape Town, but then maybe that is why Kiir is running South Sudan, and not me. Two countries that had every reason to be at the indaba to talk about mining were Namibia and Mozambique. Both have held fairly peaceful elections, their economies are growing at a reasonable pace and they have an impressive record of attracting mining investments. I had mistakenly associated Namibia with only uranium and diamond mining. The headline that impressed me was about an investment by a Swedish jeweller, Kristallen, in a gold refinery in the country. This pleased me, but mostly Namibia\\'s Minister of Trade and Industry, Calle Schlettwein, who expressed a need for his country to have its own gold refinery, although it might not have enough gold to refine. There are only two gold mines in Namibia, the Navachab Gold Mine in the Erongo region and the Otjikoto B2Gold Mine in Otjozondupa. No wonder the Namibian property market has been in non-stop growth mode for five years. Tanzania is expecting a slowdown in production and Zimbabwe is continuing to punch below its weight on the mining front, but Mozambique is making new finds in its north. An Australian company, Mozambi Resources, announced last week the signing of its option to acquire two graphite licences in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. One of these areas is reportedly near Triton Minerals\\' Nicanda Hill - considered the world\\'s largest-known deposit of graphite and vanadium. As if the coal and gas were not enough for the land of Eduardo Mondlane and Samora Machel, investors keep on streaming in. Watch out for this future hub of southern Africa! IMF on Ecobank: are we cool? South Africa has two main investors in the pan-African bank, Africa\\'s largest by footprint, the Ecobank Transnational Incorporated or simply Ecobank. These are the 20 percent shareholder, Nedbank, which paid R5bn for its stake in the Togolese-registered bank in October. The other is the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), with an 18 percent stake. A week or so ago, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised the concern that the aggressive growth by the bank posed governance risks. Subsequent reports even extended the story of the risk to the entire continent. I found that rather alarmist. Ecobank had tackled the corporate governance issue, including the dismissal of its then-group chief executive officer, Thierry Tanoh, who sued for defamation and unfair dismissal. To equate whatever governance issues there have been at Ecobank to a continent-wide crisis is a tad dramatic. The problem is that institutions like the IMF have a huge following and influence. A lot can go wrong before appropriate public relations\\' interventions can restore the confidence of the investing public in the company or country concerned. Since the publishing of the report \"Pan-African Banks - Opportunities and Challenges for Cross-Border Oversight\", Ecobank has maintained that it has addressed the issues raised by the IMF, including the introduction of processes and corporate governance structures or reforms. The report, it turned out, was dealing with matters between mid-2013 and early last year. The IMF admitted to this timing disjuncture and noted the steps taken by Ecobank to strengthen governance and avert risks to financial stability. The Ecobank has assets of more than $23bn (about R270bn). It raised about $1bn in combined equity and debt capital for its parent company and its business in Nigeria. This proves how easy it is to get facts mixed up in the rush of our desktop analysis, which would lead to undue destruction to the value of the assets of others. It also demonstrates how vigilant we must be as Africans to counter glaring media stereotypes. Toast of the week - caution beats bravado in Nigeria It is not what I would normally toast, but the decision by the Independent National Electoral Commission to postpone the elections in Nigeria from yesterday to March 28 was commendable in the circumstances. After the military had conceded that it would not be able to provide adequate security at polling stations, what other option was there? Following the spate of Boko Haram attacks across the country, the most dramatic might have been the attack by a woman suicide-bomber outside a stadium at which the incumbent president, Goodluck Jonathan, had just addressed an election rally. The woman detonated a car bomb, killing one other person and injuring eight. With seven days to to the original election date, the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission had expressed confidence that \"our level of preparedness, despite a few challenges, is sufficient to conduct free, fair and credible elections as scheduled on February 14 and February 28\". He even referred to the previous occasion, in 2011, that an election date had been postponed in Nigeria. Although the postponement has been called many names, including \"democracy deferred\", I find it rather prudent in the face of what Boko Haram has been doing and threatening. Since kidnapping schoolgirls from Chibok last year, the group has carried out attacks that have created an environment in which one would not feel comfortable to live, let alone do business. President Jonathan, unlike his opponent, Muhammadu Buhari, has supported the elections delay, while denying that he influenced the decision. This decision is my toast of the week, although I do not know if it will lead to the release of the Chibok girls before March 28 or the neutralisation of Boko Haram in Nigeria, parts of Chad, Cameroon and Niger. It is better to delay a process such as this one than to forge ahead with chutzpah when the military is pleading helplessness in the face of insurgence. May March 28 come and go swiftly, so that Africa can get its largest economy entirely back in action. Lest we forget: a focus on snippets of African history and icons for inspiration Liberia and Cameroon both celebrated important holidays on February 11. Liberia celebrated Armed Forces\\' Day on this date. The country was founded in the early \\'0s, mainly by freed slaves, modelling itself much on the US. This is why its capital, Monrovia, is named after the fifth president of the US, James Monroe. This year, the day marked the 57th Armed Forces Day and 106th year of existence of the Armed Forces of Liberia, with the theme for celebrations being \"Enhancing the capacities of the Armed Forces of Liberia to meet contemporary challenges\". Liberia is continuing to deal with the aftermath of a long civil war, although it has progressed a lot under the leadership of Africa\\'s first elected woman head of state, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. You may also know Liberia for its football star-turned-politician, the only African to have won the African, European and World Footballer of the Year awards. George Weah is a senator, having lost his bid for the presidency in 2005. In Cameroon, February 11 was celebrated as a national holiday called Youth Day to persuade the country\\'s youth to embrace education, sports and other cultural and creative activities, instead of violence. One of the greatest icons of Cameroon is saxophonist Manu Dibango, 81, whose music style and song Makossa influenced the refrain \\'Mama-se, mama-sa, mama-co-sa\\' in Michael Jackson\\'s hit Wanna Be Starting Something. n Kgomoeswana is author of Africa is Open for Business, anchor of CNBC Africa\\'s weekly show Africa Business News, and anchor |of the daily show Power Hour on PowerFM.

      "Speaking at a seminar on The State of the Nation at the University of Johannesburg, political analyst Aubrey Matshiqi made two strikingly insightful observations about the nature of public discourse in South Africa. He observed that the public discourse is under the grip of an \"echo-tower syndrome\", a situation where prominent people repeatedly engage on issues affecting those on the ground, without the actual knowledge or experience thereof. His second observation was that South Africa\\'s public discourse is broken into two polar opposites. The one is ultra-pessimism and the other ultra-optimism. Essentially, it is a conversation between two blocks that either sees doom or the best picture. What is required is to reflect on the situation in the country and determine which areas of success need consolidation and which need improvement. The ANC is on record as having said the strategic advances of the ANC government are obscured from the public eye by the heap of negative, vitriolic and personalised commentary that dominates national discourse. This can distort the government\\'s performance and present a false picture of the legacy of both the ANC government and President Jacob Zuma as the head of state. Without denying there are areas of weakness that require more work, much positive progress has been made. The Presidential Infrastructure Co-ordinating Commission (PICC) is a broad strategy of improving the state of our country\\'s infrastructure as well as pursuing economic development and job creation. It is disaggregated into 18 strategic integrated programmes (SIPs); the major projects under its umbrella are already under way and are incrementally contributing to job creation in various regions and economic sectors in our country. The long-term strategic collective output of the projects under the PICC will be the improved access |for South Africans to health-care facilities, schools, water, sanitation, housing and electrification, among others. Attached to this is the fact that increased investment in public infrastructure assets such as roads, ports, housing, schools, health-care facilities and water will lead to economic growth with expanded job creation underpinning it. Among these infrastructure interventions are initiatives such as the recapitalisation of transport assets under the transport cluster. Billions of investment in the initiative of locally assembling locomotives has begun to yield jobs and is geared to increase its yields in the long term. Furthermore, investments in broadband infrastructure have been made in an effort to improve our technological capabilities and efficiency in connectivity. This is exemplified by the international undersea cable that was started three years ago. It is meant to contribute to an increase in broadband capacity, linking South Africa and Europe and providing the state with the ability to provide broadband infrastructure to national projects such as the Square Kilometre Array. Some of these key infrastructure projects are related to energy provision, the area of great concern in the country owing to the recent shortages of energy supply by Eskom. These energy shortages are a consequence of an unbalanced relationship between the demand for power and the capacity of our energy utility to deliver a matching supply. Of course, the overriding cause for this is the dramatic increase in demand owing to the connection of vast numbers of households from the historically marginalised sections of our population. Apartheid energy infrastructure was imagined and designed to service a fraction of the population within the context of the racist social engineering of the former regime. Immediately after the fall of apartheid, the democratic government had, and has a moral obligation, to provide such services to the population, resource limitations notwithstanding at times. Thus, the need for electricity provision upstaged the maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure needed to keep up with the demand. The long-term negative spin-offs of this equation have been visited on all of us. This predicament is not manifesting without efforts to mitigate it. The government has articulated a mega-energy infrastructure project which is intended to provide a long-term power supply solution. This is within the context of consolidating an energy-sources mix that will ease pressure on the national grid and sustain the national energy resources over generations. In this regard, the government has embarked on a massive build programme to boost electricity generation through numerous projects that include the construction of the Medupi, Kusile and Ingula power stations. Once completed, the Medupi and Kusile facilities will be the fifth- and fourth-largest coal-fired power stations in the world, respectively. They are critical interventions in the area of energy utility and their effect is not short-term and thus can only be reflected upon properly in the long term. All these initiatives point to a strategic foundation for development that is being laid. Some are already bearing fruit and some have long-term progressive returns. Thus, the true legacy of the ANC government, as laid by Zuma, becomes clear when these initiatives are brought into play in public engagements, and will properly be accounted for in the long term as all their positive returns take effect. The pessimistic attitude towards the government and state of affairs in the country robs observers of the opportunity to appreciate these strategic efforts and only helps to reinforce repugnant sentiments of racism and a general distrust of a black government. n Masina is the ANC Ekurhuleni regional chairman and the Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry.

      "When world-renowned trumpeter Hugh Masekela, who is also widely known as Bra Hugh, relaunched his book, Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela at the Fort or Number Four, it might have baffled many of the event\\'s guests. The Fort at Constitution Hill in Hillbrow is a former prison known for its notoriety, incarcerating political activists during the height of the apartheid era. Figures such asNelson Mandelaand Mahatma Gandhi were among the guests of the former apartheid regime there. Notorious gangsters were also imprisoned at the Fort. It has now become a popular place with tourists after being turned into a heritage site. But what connection does Masekela have with the Fort since he was not among the political activists who once served time there, nor was he a gangster? Masekela in fact has every connection with the Fort or Number Four, and hence the relaunch there of Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela this week. The book, which sketches Masekela\\'s life from his humble birth in Witbank, a coal mining town in Mpumalanga then known for its harsh treatment of African migrant workers who were made to work in slave-like conditions, to his life in Springs and then the colourful and yet gangster-infested Alexandra township, was first published in the US in 2004. Then only 5 000 copies of the publication were shipped to South Africa . They sold out quickly and unfortunately the rest of us lost the opportunity to follow the colourful, and yet sometimes tragic life and the musical career of one of the country\\'s favourite and talented musicians, who had to leave South Africa in 1960 to pursue a musical dream first in London and later in New York, and in a way unshackle himself from the tight grip of the apartheid system. Publisher Jacana Media now has the licence from an American publisher to publish the book in South Africa, and hence the launch at the Fort on Tuesday. The choice of venue for the launch could not have been a better one as far as Masekela\\'s colourful life is concerned. \"We got off the bus at a shopping area of Rosettenville called The Hill, and walked down Third Avenue towards St Peter\\'s, a cloistered campus, comprised mostly of African students, set in the middle of an all-white, working class, racist neighbourhood... There was excitement all over the school grounds. Rose-Innes (a senior at the school and Masekela\\'s friend and neighbour from Alexandra) introduced me to his classmate Jerry Ntsipe, who adopted me on the spot and promised to watch over me,\" Masekela says in his book about his first day at this high school, which became a game-changer in his life as an aspiring musician in the 1950s. It is at St Peter\\'s that Masekela first met and befriended missionary Trevor Huddleston, who later on became instrumental in crafting Masekela\\'s musical career, and later facilitated his exit from South Africa for abroad where he spent more than 30 years in exile. \"Jerry took me to my dormitory, Number Four, the Fort,\" Masekela reveals his connection to the mystery Number Four he refers to in the book that he co-wrote with American journalist and media studies academic D Michael Cheers, who teaches visual journalism at San Jose State University in San Jose, California. In Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela, Bra Hugh opens up about his life for South Africa and the world to see, including his intense, sometimes on-and-off love life with the late South African jazz vocalist Miriam Makeba, his friendship with influential personalities and music figures, in South Africa, the African continent, as well as in the UK and US. In the book he also openly reveals his family\\'s life, traces his childhood back to the genesis of his passion for music in Mpumalanga through to the time when he was at St Peter\\'s, where with the help of Huddleston he became part of the Huddleston jazz band. It was Huddleston who gave him his first trumpet. He received his second instrument in 1956, from a man whose music he greatly respected, Louis Armstrong. He also revealed in the book how he met Makeba for the first time and how she immediately won his heart, a relationship and emotional link that would later consolidate into a marriage (they later divorced). It was Makeba and Harry Belafonte who were instrumental in getting Masekela to leave the UK in 1960 to go to the US where he won a scholarship to study at the prestigious Manhattan School of Music. Fast track this journey to a democratic South Africa and the role that Masekela continues to play in society with his music, and increasingly his outspoken nature: While his journey of drugs and debauchery and the U-turn he finally made and cleaned up is well-documented in newspapers and television programmes, it is his outspokenness on issues that often find traction with South Africans that has recently got especially women livid. For example, he recently triggered a public debate in newspapers, social media and radio stations when he said he would not take photographs with women who wear weaves, a highly emotive subject in South Africa as increasingly black women are mad about the weave, a multimillion-rand industry where some weaves cost as much as R10 000. The Sunday Independent caught up with Masekela at the launch and again revealed that wearing weaves is actually a mere symptom of what he believes are bigger, deep-seated issues afflicting African societies in post-colonial Africa, including in South Africa. \"I know I am outspoken on issues to do with heritage and who we are as Africans in post-colonial Africa, and sometimes my speaking out makes some people uncomfortable. \"The reality, though, is that the structures that were part of the colonial system are still there, including even seemingly harmless things like ceremonies. \"Our governments follow the colonial formalities in everything. Nothing has actually changed with regards to the system. \"And as Africans we are the only people in the world who like imitating everything, instead of becoming innovative and therefore globally competitive by taking our uniqueness to the world, exporting it, be it culturally or our unique identity,\" he bemoaned. He said that with regard to packaging our culture and heritage, which are rich, there is a potential to export this to the world. \"We live in a country and continent of paradoxes. For example, when tourists come to South Africa, they end up going to our national parks to look out for animals, and not us as a cultural entity. \"They look for us and they do not find us because we are not who we are. We try as much as possible to be something else, always looking to the West for cultural inspiration,\" he said. The trumpeter explained that when he left South Africa for the US, having been inspired by bebop, he initially wanted to play American jazz, just like the giants that he looked up to such as Armstrong, Miles Davis, Thelonius Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Charlie Mingus and Max Roach, to name but a few. \"But then, the very same musicians said to me, \\'Hugh, hold on. We want to hear you. If you want to play like us, then you will just become one of the statistics (of American jazz-version players). Instead, for you to become unique and successful, (you need) to play your (own) music.\\' \"I did that and ended up travelling the globe and playing my music all over the world,\" he said. He added that it was out of the context of his own experience as a musician playing his South African version of jazz all over the world that he speaks out about issues of heritage and identity and why it is important for Africans to remain themselves and not cultural imitators of other people. He revealed that he is passionate about rekindling the spirit of promoting African culture and heritage to the extent that he has now formed a cultural heritage foundation to promote these ideas. \"However, I cannot be presumptuous and stand arrogantly out there and say I am out to teach the nation about these values. \"I am here today because I am a product of this country. \"What I am doing is to give back to the country what the country gave me in the first place. As a musician, you cannot afford to be arrogant because once you do that you are finished,\" he declared. Masekela, who turns 77 in a few months\\' time, has over the years emerged as one of the most hard-working musicians. Besides his globe-trotting schedule performing, he still has time to get involved in other projects. In recent years he penned Songs of Migration, a musical about the history of migrant labour, which performed to critical acclaim at the Market Theatre in Joburg, before heading overseas for a season. Currently, Bra Hugh is shooting a television comedy show, Bantu Hour (See Life supplement), in which he plays the role of co-executive producer and co-host with funnyman Kagiso Lediga.\n",

      "SO MANY potatoes, so little time is a mantra worth repeating when you visit Newtown\\'s The Potato Shed. Opened in late 2015, The Potato Shed is housed in the historic building (from 1911) that was once Joburg\\'s potato shed, serving the city\\'s vegetable market in Newtown. Trivia buffs: should seek out the railway tracks running alongside the restaurant\\'s outdoor deck to impress your friends. This is a slick urban sister restaurant to the Life CafÃ© brand usually found in malls, designed and produced by Maira Koutsoudakis and team who are known for innovative leisure-inspired architecture and interior designs. It\\'s a great location. Next door is the fabulous local design emporium Work Shop New Town; across the piazza Newtown Junction Mall (with plenty of secure covered parking) and City Lodge Newtown Hotel (think city weekend getaway), a short walk along the paved avenue is The Market Theatre. But back to the potato. As the centrepiece of this eatery\\'s menu the spud shines. From whirly triple- fried chips and wood-oven roasted potatoes to slashed and stuffed spuds, crispy potato skins, string fries, mashed potatoes and even an aloo pakora battered mustard mash bread, it\\'s veritable potato porn. And enough to make Banting diet advocate Dr Tim Noakes apply for a court interdict. The menu here shows great attention to detail and a real desire to tantalise the taste buds. There\\'s plenty of the expected served in delightfully unexpected ways, like the bunny chow filled with pulled pork or Jozi beef, some pickled fish or a selection of vegetable pickles from the restaurant\\'s \"Curing Room\". Meat dishes from the fire pit are designed for large appetites and include a 1kg fire-pit poker of lamb on the coals with oregano, lemon and garlic and a 1kg hot chicken poker spiced in Mozambican \"pele pele\" style. Portions are large enough to satisfy a flock of hungry miners and it is advisable to eat here with people who enjoy sharing their food. Perhaps send a questionnaire to friends before you book. In keeping with The Potato Shed\\'s steam-punk-BBQ- smokehouse-bootlegger-hideaway inspired interior is a celebration of some industrial age cooking methods. We didn\\'t get to try dessert, but they looked suitably decadent, especially the Fire on Ice blow-torched meringue chocolate ice cream with black cherries, confit oranges and chocolate cake.There\\'s a fine drinks selection, a wraparound bar and a party atmosphere on the outside deck on weekends.

If you don\\'t know what these things are, ask for an English menu and prepare your stomach for a mammoth meal. Traditional Afrikaans cuisine, or Boerekos, is rich and hearty and has never been known for small portions. The Bergbron Plaaskombuis pays homage to the South African flavours of chef and owner Johan Smith\\'s childhood, particularly the traditional boerekos that his grandmother used to cook. It\\'s the kind of unpretentious and good value comfort food you\\'d more typically find far from a big city like Joburg. The cafÃ© is set out just as you might find at a farm kitchen in many small South African towns. A long, shady stoep or veranda, lined by window boxes filled with herbs, occupies the entire side of a single-storey building which overlooks a small garden nursery. There\\'s a padstal or farm shop selling local home-made jams and preserves, and a soaring steel wind pump stands guard at the entrance. Everything on the menu is home-made on the day according to time-honoured recipes handed down through Johan\\'s family. There\\'s Tannie (Auntie) Una\\'s deeply flavoursome lamb stew, Tannie Bessie\\'s filling chicken pie and Oupa (Grandpa) Andries\\'s sausages spiced with cayenne pepper. Even the bread is freshly baked on site each morning and if you arrive at the right time you\\'ll be treated to the sight of trays of fluffy fresh scones emerging from the old-fashioned coal-fired oven which sits on the veranda. Service is warm and friendly and guests are greeted with a small glass of refreshing gemmer bier (ginger beer) on arrival. So popular is this home-made ginger beer that Bergbron reportedly sells up to 75 litres of the stuff on a weekend day. There\\'s also moerkoffie on the stove on weekends. Made by simmering coarsely ground coffee for several hours, the coffee gets stronger as the day goes on until it reaches pure rocket fuel strength. Breakfast is served all day and options include the sonop jaffel (sunrise toastie) with fried egg, bacon and cheese, putu pap (crumbly maize porridge) with maalvleis (minced meat) or a classic cooked breakfast with all the works, served in rustic enamel plates.

      "LAST Sunday, we embarked on an adventure: we took the steam train to Stellenbosch and it was delightful. Twice a month, Atlantic Rail chuffs off to the winelands with a locomotive built in 1926 pulling wood-panelled coaches almost 100 years old. They date from 1918 to the 1930s. The crew on board are members of Friends Of Atlantic Rail - all volunteers who do this in their spare time for the love of old trains - and they are more than happy to tell you more if you are interested. I am a sucker for statistics so learning it takes five to six tons of coal and 10â€†000 litres of water for the trip was right up my alley. \"We assist Atlantic Rail in operating their trains,\" Stefan Andrzejewski, one of the friends since the organisation was founded six years ago, told us. \"We currently have 72 members, 45 of whom are active.\" It was a dismal day but the rain did not dampen our spirits. We arrived at the appointed time and place - the Train Lodge - and found our seat in what was once a dining car. Other accommodation is in two-or four-person berths, the â€¨kind you would have slept in â€¨once upon a time. In the bar coach you can get tea, coffee (the milk is in one of those retro lidded turquoise Tupperware jugs all our grannies had) brightly iced cupcakes and hard tack. We gasped when we found there was no wine, but my friend had cleverly packed a tiny hip flask filled with a fine single malt Scotch, which saved the day. The trip out of Cape Town is not terribly scenic for much of the way, to be honest, but simply being on the train was good enough for us as we clapped our hands in glee. The first stop was near Vredenheim, where some passengers got off for their day on the wine farm. We continued to Stellenbosch, where we were allowed about three-and-a-half hours to entertain ourselves. A quick Uber into the centre of the town deposited us at hustling and bustling Schoon, where I had once had a cup of thick chocolate which I have never forgotten. Sadly, they don\\'t make it anymore, and I had to make do with hot frothy milk and chocolate buttons. From there we strolled around, browsed in an art gallery, bought jewellery and a beaded spectacle case, then looked for somewhere for lunch. Just as the heavens opened for a serious and prolonged downpour, we slid into the last available table at Man\\'Oushe, seduced by the Johnny Cash they were playing. Sadly, this later broke down into Lebanese pop music but it was time to go anyway; the bottle of Graham Beck Railroad Red - which could have been specially made for us that day - had been depleted. Next stop was Brampton Wine Studio to get supplies for the home journey. If you are ever in Stellies and looking for good reasonably priced wine - as in cellar door prices - this is where you should go.

      "SITUATED on the top floor of Rosebank\\'s newly opened Trumpet building, Marble restaurant has distinct polish and finesse. It was a warm Monday evening and, with its being my friend\\'s birthday the following day, I was delighted to find that, unlike many restaurants, acclaimed chef David Higgs\\'s newly established Marble was open. As a starter, we shared a plate of spicy chicken wings. Basted in a thick and particularly spicy sauce, they were a bit too peppery for my friend, but I thought they were just right. Blackened octopus and overnight coal-roasted soup are among the other intriguing starter options. On the waiter\\'s advice, I ordered the pork neck and my friend a well-done sirloin steak. My pork neck came with a lovely grilled pineapple, jalapeÃ±o syrup, remoulade and pork crackling. I also ordered fries as a side. The sirloin came with a spinach and mushroom salad, roasted cauliflower, and fries. My friend found himself regretting ordering his steak well done as it was a bit tough to chew and bland on the taste buds. My pork neck on the other hand was tender and delicate, the pineapple and jalapeÃ±o syrup giving it a palatable sweetness. Other mains include rib-eye steak, prawns, and lamb cutlets. Marble embraces South Africa\\'s unique braai heritage by employing a wood-fired grill, with the chefs preparing food on an open fire in the exposed kitchen. The fire burns cleanly, with barely a puff of smoke. Despite its selection of salads, Marble is distinctly meat-focused. After the filling portions of our mains, we shared an ice-cream sandwich - almond meringue with halva ice cream. It wasn\\'t mind-blowing, but it served as a delicate and sweet taster. Other dessert options include a passion fruit parfait and a strawberry concoction with burnt strawberries, pistachio creme, ash meringue, and a Greek dessert of nut-and-honey pastry rolls, kataifi. With its wood and marble decor, Marble is a smooth blend of sophisticated and down-to-earth dining. It will soon be opening a boutique butchery offering some of the cuts available in the restaurant. After dinner, my friend and I retreated to the bar area to cap off our evening with drinks. Situated in its own sleek and elegant corner, this contemporary bar has a completely different feel from the restaurant. A huge glass-encased wine rack with a few dozen wine and champagne bottles stands between the main area of the restaurant and the bar. The bar has its own menu, with a unique selection of bites and a wide variety of cocktails. A mixologist is on hand to mix any drink of your liking from the wide range of mixers available - we enjoyed trying out a few drinks, including the fiery hand grenade shooter.

Sipho Mabuse remembers that performance at Orlando West High School in Soweto with a sense of achievement, as well as joy and gratitude for the support he has enjoyed from South Africans and the world. He describes 2016 as a remarkable year, which witnessed amazing shows to mark his golden jubilee. However, he has dedicated 2017 to more special concerts to celebrate his milestone achievements in the industry. The multi-instrumentalist\\'s five decades in the industry were defined by unwavering commitment and a pioneering contribution to South African music. Among his numerous landmark achievements he lists producing Miriam Makeba\\'s platinum-achieving album, Welela (1989), as well as performing alongside Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and Baaba Maal at the 46664 concert for Nelson Mandela in New York. Born Sipho Cecil Peter Mabuse on November 2, 1951, in Orlando West, he has distinguished himself as a versatile musician who has played everything from township disco to jazz. Mabuse\\'s seminal recordings set the tone for the Afro funk and Soweto soul era in the late 1960s and spearheaded the golden decade of township pop in the 1980s. Born into a musical family, his father, a coal merchant, played harmonica. Baba Manuel, a neighbour and traditional healer, influenced his love of drums. His greatest influences included Early Mabuza, Gordon Mfandu and Gerald Khoza - all of them top drummers in the history of South African jazz. \"One of my fondest memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life was when I was 14 and Early Mabuza walked into the studio and asked to sit on my drum kit to practise,\" he recalled. Mabuse was playing drums as a member of his school\\'s cadet band when he was spotted by fellow pupil, Selby Ntuli. Together with a schoolmate and bass player, Alec \"Om\" Khaoli, they formed The Beaters. Guitarist and keyboard player Ntuli was the band leader until his death in 1978. Their creative and original music became the soundtrack of the black consciousness movement. It was called Soweto soul. \"There was a void our music filled,\" he said. \"It served a much higher purpose, which was to mentally emancipate black people from a feeling of passive helplessness into a world of strength through song. \"We were all the sons and daughters of Africa, working on our strengths to take what we did to another level. As scary as those dark days were through the 1970s, strangely I remember them with fondness.\" The Beaters listened to a wide variety of styles, which included The Manhattan Brothers, Miriam Makeba, The Ink Spots and foreign artists such as Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley, Otis Redding and Jimi Hendrix. Their first album, Soul-A-Go-Go, was released in 1969, a year after the band\\'s formation. Bacon and Eggs (1970) and Mumsy Hips (1971) followed later. In 1975, Mabuse and Khaoli joined pianist Pat Matshikiza and the great altoist Kippie Moeketsi in a studio as members of the rhythm section for a recording of Tshona, an album that became one of the popular classics of South African jazz. \"As a young musician I had a high regard for Bra Kippie because he was an incredibly talented musician who has raised the profile of South African jazz. \"We met at a time when he was a very angry and disgruntled musician who felt that his talents had gone unappreciated by South African society. During the Tshona sessions his mastery of the alto sax was clear, and we decided to feature him on our next album, Rufaro (1978).\" In 1976, they toured the then Rhodesia. What was intended as a three-week visit became a remarkably successful three-month tour. On their return they released an album, Harari, as a tribute to the people of the township of the same name outside Salisbury, the capital. It inspired the band\\'s name change to Harari. The band attracted some of the country\\'s hottest guitarists, Funky Masike Mohapi, Saitana Ndimande, Doc Mthalane, Condry Ziqubu and Zimbabwean-born Louis Mhlanga. Seasoned jazzmen like Kippie Moeketsi, Themba Mokoena, Barney Rachabane, Dennis Mpale and Stompie Manana also featured on Harari albums. In 1978 Hugh Masekela invited Harari to the US, but Selby Ntuli\\'s death robbed them of the opportunity to go. Mabuse effectively became the band\\'s new leader. Highlights of those years included supporting and backing Percy Sledge, Timmy Thomas and Brook Benton during their South African tours. They were all impressed with Harari\\'s incredible musicianship. In 1979, they became the first black pop group to appear on SABC TV. The following year they became the first black group to headline their own show at the Colosseum, a landmark music venue in Joburg. In the same year they were featured in a BBC documentary. They were the aristocrats of South African pop. Heatwave (1980) was released in America. Party (1982) entered the American Disco Hot 100 charts. At the pinnacle of their career in 1982, Harari disbanded - its members pursuing solo careers or forming new bands. Mabuse retained the name and used it to nurture young talent. Future stars like Chico Twala and Kamazu were part of the new youthful Harari. His other project at the time was the Soweto Soul Orchestra, which involved 40 musicians - something unheard of among black artists at the time. In 1983 he launched a groundbreaking solo career as Sipho \"Hotstix\" Mabuse - the nickname he was given by fellow musician Condry Ziqubu because of his hot style of drumming. His debut album, Rise (1983) sold an incredible 132â€¯000 copies. \"The break-up of Harari on the threshold of an international breakthrough was the most heartbreaking experience for me, second to Selby\\'s passing. I needed an emotional lift. Rise became that lift,\" he explains. Its successor Burn Out (1984) made recording history with half a million units and stayed on top of the charts of every radio station for weeks. It was a crossover hit that captured every South African across the racial divide. The album changed the texture of Afro pop and township jive like no other song or artist in local pop history. Burn Out also became an international multiplatinum phenomenon. The artist signed a R1.5â€¯million deal with Virgin Records to have it released in the UK. It was also released in Germany, Japan and the US. The CBS deal in the US placed him in an elite stable of international superstars like Michael Jackson and the Rolling Stones. The success of Burn Out made him one of the most sought-after performers at concerts and festivals in Europe. His next album Afrodizzia (1986) underscored his newfound status as a world-class performer with global acclaim. Produced by Virgin Records, it reached platinum status within three weeks of its release. The album\\'s single, Shikisha, became such a monster hit the album was sold as Shikisha for the European market. It is a soundtrack on Throw Momma from the Train (1987), the American comedy film starring Danny de Vito, Billy Crystal and saxophonist Branford Marsalis. Chant of the Marching (1989) features Miriam Makeba and was banned on SABC radio. What About Tomorrow (1991) and Township Child (1996) are among the albums he released under a free South Africa. An artist of many parts, Mabuse has also produced albums for other top South African artists including Hugh Masekela, Miriam Makeba, Ray Phiri and Sibongile Khumalo. In the early 1990s he made his mark in radio broadcasting when he presented jazz shows on 702 Talk Radio and Metro FM. In the mid-1990s he took over Kippies as the popular Joburg jazz venue\\'s manager. During his tenure he hosted international superstars like Stevie Wonder, Jonathan Butler, Al Jarreau and Thelonius Monk jr. In 2011 he celebrated his 60th birthday in style when he finally obtained his matric certificate - having attained pop stardom as a schoolboy made it impossible for him to finish his studies. \"There are so many more wonderful stories, through my 50-year-long pilgrimage, that have made this ride truly extraordinary.\" At 65 he is convinced he still has a critical role to play in the South African music scene. One thing is for sure. Mabuse has already created an outstanding legacy in South African music. Mabuse will celebrate his golden jubilee when he shares the stage with Freshlyground for the first time at Spier Amphitheatre, Stellenbosch, on March 25 between 6pm and 9pm.\n",

      "Article 152:\n",
      "WHEN Ben Ngubane was South Africa\\'s ambassador to Japan from 2004 to 2008 his counterparts from other African states told him about lucrative business opportunities in the oil and gas drilling sectors in the western parts of the continent. Ngubane, a former KwaZulu-Natal premier who resigned under a cloud this week as chairperson of Eskom, told The Sunday Indepen-dent that at the end of his tour of duty in Japan he returned home and motivated to explore these mining opportunities. His interest was concentrated on the Central African Republic (CAR), where he had been told gas and oil were in abundance, and drilling opportunities were freely available. The former IFP leader, whose name features prominently in the leaked Gupta e-mails relating to state capture, and also in the then public protectorThuli Madonsela\\'sState of Capture report, confirmed that he and businessman Salim Essa, a Gupta associate, travelled to the CAR in 2013 to strike a deal. Ngubane said Essa had been keen to partner with him. \"The plan was to go to West Africa and to buy oil blocs. Another company from India was going to drill these blocs - and we were going to sell the oil for huge sums of money.\" He said Essa had arranged a trip to the CAR for March 2013, with the Guptas having made a private jet available to them for the journey. \"But then we decided not to go,\" said Ngubane. The trip was called off because of the civil war that was raging in the CAR at that time, he said. \"I said to him: \\'We can\\'t go there. We cannot get involved in that part of the world. It is too unstable and too dangerous\\'. That\\'s where the talks ended,\" Ngubane said. He complained that his critics were now using his relationship with Essa as a stick with which to beat him, accusing him of being a Gupta ally. \"Now I am told a copy of my passport is with the Guptas. That is nonsense,\" he said. But he nevertheless believed the Gupta family were being unfairly discriminated against by \"white capital monopoly\". He was scathing about Madonsela\\'s report, describing it as \"a creation to try to bring down any black company or person wanting to enter the area of commerce that white companies dominate\". \"Any business persons, as long as they do business legally, are above board and accountable to the legislation of the country and to the regulatory authorities, can do business in South Africa. As black people, we must also be allowed to enter that space,\" he said. Even after resigning, Ngubane said he and members of the Eskom board were still being subjected to an investigation by the parliamen-tary portfolio committee on public enterprises. This comes as the DA raised concerns that Ngubane\\'s resignation should not exonerate him from liability for the breakdown of gover-nance at the power utility. DA spokesperson on public enterprises Natasha Mazzone said Ngubane still had much to answer for as his resignation came \"hot on the heels of damning revelations of the capture of Eskom leadership by the Guptas, and the breakdown of corporate governance at Eskom\". \"Ngubane, who presided over the retrenchment/retirement/re-hire of Brian Molefe as Eskom CEO, has much to answer for, not least of which includes (Brian) Molefe\\'s R30-million \\'golden handshake\\' deal and an avalanche of accusations that the Guptas have milked Eskom over many years,\" Mazzone said. \"Ngubane\\'s resignation will not exonerate him from liability for the breakdown of governance at the power utility, and the DA will use the parliamentary inquiry into Eskom, set to commence on June 21, to hold Ngubane to account.\" Mazzone said allegations by former mineral resources minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi that Molefe and Ngubane had tried to strong-arm him to withdraw Glencore\\'s Optimum mining licences in order to guarantee that the Guptas would take over Glencore\\'s coal mines had yet to be probed. So did the alleged Matshela Koko R1-billion nepotism scandal, which Mazzone said happened on Ngubane\\'s watch.\n",

      "Article 156:\n",
      "ON NOVEMBER 3, Standard Bank senior political economist Simon Freemantle published a report, The prospects for and implications of an NDZ win. The format in which the report is written is calculated to make it appear at first glance as if it is objective. However, the further one reads the more the mask of academic pretence drops and questions arise. The research is weak and shallow. It appears to be mostly a cut-and-paste job from biased newspaper articles that were written as anti-Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma smear pieces. One cannot help but wonder why a senior political economist would produce such shoddy work. Was Freemantle under pressure from his employers at Standard Bank to deliver a document that could be used to de-campaign Dlamini Zuma? Was he given instructions on what the conclusions of his so-called research should be? This flimsy document certainly has all the appearances of Freemantle abusing his academic credentials in order to create the fake impression of academic objectivity, while it is a piece of biased pseudo-academic propaganda. Is the report really intended for Standard Bank clients? It purports to be for internal use only, Standard Bank and its clients - and not for public distribution - but within hours after it was internally released, it was posted in PDF format all over social media networks. A concerted effort was made to distribute it as widely as possible and to reach the biggest possible audience. Not only does the document display all the traits of a propaganda piece, but the manner in which it was distributed - with the clear intention to reach and influence the widest possible audience - also seemed like propaganda. As far as \"servicing the client base of Standard Bank\", the report must be seen as of little value to the clients since it is based on hardly any scientific grounding for business forecasting. For example, regardless of the outcome of the ANC\\'s national elective conference next month, the rating agencies might downgrade South Africa. It is a fact that Moody\\'s and Standard & Poor\\'s will decide not only on their biased political interpretations, but also based on international economic trends, which the government has little control over, to downgrade South Africa. Markets are well aware of this and have started to factor that into their planning. Freemantle refers to the narrative of \"fiscal downslide\" if Dlamini Zuma wins. However, in contrast to the leaked recommendation of the Heher Commission on free tertiary education, that it is not feasible from an economic/fiscal perspective, Cyril Ramaphosa in his campaign - similar to the strong position Dlamini Zuma has taken in favour of free quality education - has indicated that \"students need free education\". This is in contrast to the leaked findings of the commission that it is not affordable. It must be noted that the commission\\'s finding is controversial, that it is disputable and needs further research and political consideration. It is certainly not a \"proven economic fact\" that free tertiary education will lead to a fiscal downslide. Despite being a senior political economist, Freemantle ignores this and in a biased manner treats it as a so-called fact. He uses this to argue that her strong policy position in favour of free quality education will lead to a fiscal downslide. Furthermore, he uses the narrative that policies \"such as this will deliver a message to the market of political and patronage continuity, rather than the decisive economic and institutional re-gearing\". The fact is that radical economic transformation goes back to the initial, Freedom Charter-based, commitment of the ANC for a fundamental restructuring of the economic relations in favour of the majority (especially black people), with \"re-gearing\" being a necessity to ensure long-term political stability in the country. To argue that Dlamini Zuma will specifically deliver an unpalatable message to the market is simply an opinion of Freemantle and those he represents; it is not at all based on market dynamics. In fact the markets would like to maximise profits. Dlamini Zuma\\'s policies in favour of radical economic transformation will maximise profit and efforts towards poverty alleviation. Freeman\\'s main arguments can therefore be criticised as follows: 1. \"The damaging preservation of the status quo\": Radical economic transformation is not the status quo. This is a fact Freemantle ignores. Radical economic transformation will prevent South Africa from sliding into political instability. In September the latest statistics showed the untenable poverty situation in the country - facts Freemantle ignored in his interpretation. Furthermore Ramaphosa also indicated that the \"land question\" must be resolved. Freemantle ignored this fact. Somehow Freemantle argues that the markets would prefer Ramaphosa. This is not based on any scientific study. Furthermore, he does not acknowledge that markets will always protect imperialistic outcomes and will try to postpone maximising poverty alleviation. The question should be asked: is this sustainable? How long can that be maintained before a downslide to political instability and violence? 2. \"Public Sector wage increases\": The fact is that Cosatu opposed Ramaphosa\\'s views on the national minimum wage. Ramaphosa\\'s election will not necessarily render the negotiation process with trade unions less complex. To argue in this way makes it a biased opinion, with the intention to promote Ramaphosa as Standard Bank\\'s preferred candidate, not based on any scientific argument. 3. The rationalisation of key state-owned enterprises: Ramaphosa said recently that \"we cannot just throw away SAA\". The fact is that even if he wins, he will not rationalise key SOEs as Freemantle indicates. Freemantle\\'s \"selective sale\" of state assets is more complex than indicated and it is not ANC policy. To what extent will Cosatu and the Federation of Unions of South Africa accept this? 4. Nuclear: Nuclear is not a one-year project as nuclear expert Chris Yelland indicated; it is a 10- to 12-year project. Who can say with certainty that enough electricity will be available in 2030? Is coal and diesel sustainable to generate electricity? These arguments do not form part of the report. Thus they must be seen as opinions. Against this background Freemantle wrote a report based on his own opinions and guided by CR17 campaigners and Standard Bank\\'s bias in favour of Ramaphosa\\'s candidature. This report was never meant to be an \"academic piece\" to objectively be of service to Standard Bank clients. It is hardly of any academic or scientific value. It is cheap propaganda that deserves to be consigned to the rubbish bin. Standard Bank and its senior political economist should be ashamed of themselves for intervening in this manner in the internal politics of the ANC and for trying to influence the outcome of our national elective conference. Fortunately they have done it in such an amateurish and ham-fisted manner that it was from the start doomed to fail dismally. n Niehaus is a former member ANC NEC member and an Umkhonto we Sizwe veteran.
